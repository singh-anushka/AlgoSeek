# AlgoSeek

AlgoSeek is a search engine designed to search DSA (data structures and algorithms) problems across various CP platforms.
It has a user-friendly experience and finds search results in a few seconds. The search engine uses the BM 25 similarity function to estimate the relevance of documents in the database to the given search query.
A Node.js + Express server runs the search engine. HTML, BootStrap CSS, and EJS are used for the frontend use. The database is created by scrapping the web using Beautiful Soup and Selenium in Python. For storage, MongoDBâ€”a specialized search engine designed exclusively for searching competitive programming questions across multiple CP platforms.
