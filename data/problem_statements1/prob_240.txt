You are given a tree consisting of NN nodes. The nodes are numbered from 11 to NN. The tree is rooted at the node 11. 
A tree is a connected undirected graph with N−1N−1 edges.
Find the sum of the distance between nodes xx and yy over all tuples (u,v,x,yu,v,x,y) satisfying the following conditions:
1)1) u<vu<v
2)2) uu is the ancestor of node xx and vv is the ancestor of node yy.
3)3) Neither of uu or vv is the ancestor of the other.
Since the sum can be enormous, print it modulo (109+7)(109+7).
Note:

The distance between two nodes of a tree is the number of edges in the shortest path between these two nodes.
Node xx is considered to be the ancestor of yy if xx lies on the path from 11 to yy.
Usually, there is no bound on the stack memory and is equal to the total memory limit of 1.5 GB. But due to a system configuration issue, the stack limit for C++ is temporarily set to 8 MB. So, if you believe that your code requires a larger stack limit, please include this in your code.

Input Format

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test contains an integer NN, denoting the number of nodes in the tree.
N−1N−1 lines follow. The ithith of these lines contains two space-separated integers uiui and vivi, denoting an edge between the nodes uiui and vivi.

Output Format
For each test case, output in a single line the sum obtained modulo (109+7)(109+7).

Explanation
Test case 11: There is no such tuple satisfying the constraints.
Test case 22: (2,3,2,3)(2,3,2,3) is the only valid tuple and distance between node 22 and node 33 is 22.
