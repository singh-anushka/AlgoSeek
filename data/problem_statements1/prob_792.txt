The title of the problem has nothing to do with the problem. You are given an integer N and an array C of positive integers of size N.Is there a weighted graph with positive integer weights on N vertices such that sum of weights of edges adjacent to vertex i is C[i] and weight of edge between i and j is at most i bitwise-xor j
Input
 First line contains T, the number of test cases. Each test case consists of 2 lines. First Line contains N, the number of nodes in the graph.
Next line contains N integers, denoting array C

Output
output on a single line "Yes" if such a graph exists,"No" otherwise. 
Constraints

2 ≤ T ≤ 5
2 ≤ N ≤ 100
1 ≤ C[i] ≤ 10^5

 
Example
Input1:
1
2
2 2
Input2:
1
3
2 3 2

Output1:
Yes

Output2:
No


 
Explanation
Example case 1. We have a single edge of weight 2 between 1 and 2
Example case 2. No graph is possible
