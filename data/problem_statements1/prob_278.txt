Chef Shahhoud wants to hire new chefs for his restaurant. Shahhoud posted a job offer on Chef Rami's paper "Fast Food Times".
NN candidates (numbered 11 through NN) have applied for the job. There are MM traits that define how good a chef is. You are given NN strings S1,S2,…,SNS1,S2,…,SN describing the traits of the candidates. Each of these strings has length MM. For each valid ii and jj, the jj-th character of SiSi is '1' if the ii-th chef has the jj-th trait or '0' if this chef does not have this trait.
Shahhoud wants to choose a non-empty subsequence HH (not necessarily contiguous) of the sequence (1,2,…,N)(1,2,…,N) and hire all candidates from HH. However, the sequence HH must satisfy an additional condition: for any two consecutive elements of HH (let's denote them by xx and yy), candidates xx and yy have no common traits, to prevent fights between them.
Now, Shahhoud is wondering: how many such valid subsequences exist? Find this number modulo 1,000,000,0071,000,000,007 (109+7109+7).
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and MM.
NN lines follow. For each ii (1≤i≤N1≤i≤N), the ii-th of these lines contains a single string SiSi.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number of valid subsequences modulo 1,000,000,0071,000,000,007.

Explanation
