You are given two arrays(A and B) each of size NN.
In one step you can choose any two index ll and r such that 1≤l≤r≤N and increment B[i] by 1 for l≤i≤r.
Find the minimum number of steps required to make both are identical.
Input:

First line will contain N, size of each array. 
Second line contains N space separated integers, ith number denotes the value of A[i]. 
Third line contains N space separated integers, ith number denotes the value of B[i]. 

Output:
Print the minimum number of steps required to make both arrays identical.
Constraints

1≤N≤100000
0≤B[i]≤A[i]≤109

Sample Input:
5
1 2 3 4 5
1 1 1 4 1

Sample Output:
6

EXPLANATION:
We can select the following ranges : [2,3] once, [3,3] once and [5,5] four times.
