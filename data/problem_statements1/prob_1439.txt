You are given a sequence A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN. You have to split the array into maximum number of non-empty subarrays such that the gcd of elements of each subarray is equal to 1.
Input:

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.

Output:
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the maximum number of subarrays formed, or −1 if the array cannot be split while satisfying the above condition.
