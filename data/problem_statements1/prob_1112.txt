You are given two integers A and B, in which one of them is guaranteed to be equal to 2.
With A and B, you are allowed to create any number X which can be expressed as M∗A+N∗B for any non-negative integers M and N.
Find out the number of natural numbers which cannot be expressed as stated above. If there are infinite of them then print −1.
Input:

First and only line will contain two space separated integers A and B, of which at-least one is guaranteed to be equal to 2.

Output:
Print the number of natural numbers that cannot be expressed as stated in the problem statement, if there are infinite of them then print −1
Constraints
