Chef always loves to solve triangle problem.But due to his illness chef is not able to solve
his triangle problem. Can you help Chef to solve this problem?
Your task is to  print "YES" if triangle is possible and find out the area of the  triangle. Otherwise print "NO"(if not possible).  
For every test case given inputs a, b, and c,three sides of triangle.
Input:

First line will contain TT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
Each testcase contains of a single line of input, three integers a,b,c. 

Output:
For each testcase, output in a single line answer "YES"(if triangle possible) and area of triangle correct upto five decimal places space separated. Otherwise "NO".
Constraints

1≤T≤105
1≤a,b,c≤107

Sample Input:
2
 3 4 5
 2 4 7
Sample Output:
YES 6.00000
 NO
EXPLANATION:
For 1st test case Triangle is possible. And area is 6.00000
And for 2nd test case triangle is not possible.
