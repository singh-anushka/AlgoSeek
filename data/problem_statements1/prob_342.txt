Munchi and BlackHammer like to play games. BlackHammer gives Munchi 2 numbers N and M and allowes him to perform following operations on the numbers-

Subtract 1 from any one of the numbers.
Divide both the numbers by their gcd.



Now, Munchi wants to know the minimum number of operations to convert (N,M) to (1,1).

Input

First line contains T - Number of test cases.
Next T lines contain 2 integers N, M

Output
Minimum operations to convert both N and M to 1.

Constraints

1≤T≤104
1≤N,M≤500

Example

Sample Input
1
8 4


Sample Output
2


Explaination
-Operation 2: N=2 M=1
-Operation 1(on N): N=1 M=1
