Nadaca is a country with NN cities. These cities are numbered 11 through NN and connected by MM bidirectional roads. Each city can be reached from every other city using these roads.
Initially, Ryan is in city 11. At each of the following KK seconds, he may move from his current city to an adjacent city (a city connected by a road to his current city) or stay at his current city. Ryan also has QQ conditions (a1,b1),(a2,b2),…,(aQ,bQ)(a1,b1),(a2,b2),…,(aQ,bQ) meaning that during this KK-second trip, for each valid ii, he wants to be in city aiai after exactly bibi seconds.
Since you are very good with directions, Ryan asked you to tell him how many different trips he could make while satisfying all conditions. Compute this number modulo 109+7109+7. A trip is a sequence of Ryan's current cities after 1,2,…,K1,2,…,K seconds.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers NN, MM and KK.
Each of the next MM lines contains two space-separated integers uu and vv denoting a road between cities uu and vv.
The next line contains a single integer QQ.
QQ lines follow. For each ii (1≤i≤Q1≤i≤Q), the ii-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers aiai and bibi.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number of trips Ryan can make, modulo 109+7109+7.
