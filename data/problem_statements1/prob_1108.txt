People think that Gump is a genius, but the truth is that luck has always been on his side. No one knows how he always comes up with solutions to complex problems and becomes everyone’s hero.
He has been challenged once again, and this time it’s not that simple. He is given with the length N and sum S of a sequence A of numbers, and he has to:
Step 1: Find all possible sequences of numbers of length N with sum S
Step 2: Find the products of all such sequences respectively
Step 3: Print the maximum one
Gump is really busy this time, and he doesn’t have time for this challenge, can you solve this one for him?
Input:

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
Each testcase contains of a single line of input, two space-separated integers N and S. 

Output:
For each testcase, follow the above mentioned steps and perform Step 3. Print it modulo 109+7.
