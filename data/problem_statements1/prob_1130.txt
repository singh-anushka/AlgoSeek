Motu and Patlu have won a Jackpot of n bags of Samosas. Each bag is tagged with a number from 1 to n and the number of Samosas contained in each bag is equal to the tag number.
(eg: Bag1 contains 1 Samosa and Bag2 contains 2 Samosas, etc…)
Motu and Patlu have decided to divide the bags among themselves such that the total number of Samosas each of them receive is equal.
Sum(M) - Sum(P) = 0
Sum(M): the total number of Samosas in the bags that Motu receives
Sum(P): the total number of Samosas in the bags that Patlu receives
Determine if it is possible to divide equally. Note: Samosas should be divided as a whole. (Splitting a Samosa into fractions is not possible)
Input Format

The input contains N, the number of bags of Samosas. 

Output Format
For each testcase, output in a single line “YES” if it is possible and “NO” if it is not. (Without quotation marks)
You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes" and "YES" will all be treated as identical).
Constraints

1≤N≤1000


                        Sample Input 1
                        





3



                        Sample Output 1
                        





YES


Explanation
Motu -> {Bag1, Bag2} (Sum = 3)
Patlu -> {Bag3} (Sum = 3)

                        Sample Input 2
                        





6



                        Sample Output 2
                        





NO


Explanation
It is impossible to divide the bags among Motu and Patlu such that they receive an equal number of Samosas.

                        Sample Input 3
                        





10



                        Sample Output 3
                        





NO


Explanation
It is impossible to divide the bags among Motu and Patlu such that they receive an equal number of Samosas.
