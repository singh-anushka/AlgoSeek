Today, Ram and friends have come out to play.
Ram has brought a Frisbee for today's game!    
Ram has N friends numbered from 1 to N , and they decided to play for X minutes.    
The game's rules are as follows: 

All players stand in a circle.
Ram starts the game and passes the frisbee to one (it can be anyone) of his friends.
Any player who recieves the frisbee is free to pass the frisbee towards any other player immediately (no time gap).
The frisbee takes 1 minute to go from one player to another (regardless of the distance).
The game will end after X minutes have completed (the frisbee recieved at the end of the last minute is counted).

They will be happy if before the end of the game , every player has interacted with the other N players at least once.
Recieving and passing frisbee both count as interactions.
Ex- If player A passes the frisbee to player B, 
it can be said that player A has interacted with player B and player B has interacted with player A as well.
Note: Total number of players is N+1 (including Ram himself).
Given N and X , you are to print if Ram and friends will be happy or not. 

Input:

First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
Each testcase contains of a single line of input, two integers N,X. 


Output:
For each testcase, output in a single line "Happy" if they will complete the game before the end else  print "Unhappy" if they won't be able to complete the game before the end.

Constraints

1≤T≤1000
1≤N≤10000
1≤X≤109


Sample Input:
2
2 2
2 3

Sample Output:
Unhappy
Happy

EXPLANATION:
In the first case there are a total of 3 people and time left is 2 minutes, 
So it's not possible for every player to interact with the other 2 players.
In the second case there are a total of 3 people and time left is 3 minutes,
So it's possible for every player to interact with the other 2 players.
One possible way is [Ram->1, 1->2, 2->Ram].
