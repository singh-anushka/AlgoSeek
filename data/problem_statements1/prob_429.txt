Rhett and Link are partners in the game Mythical Beasts. In this game, if Rhett kills a monster, he gains experience points(XP) equal to the level of the monster that is killed. As a result, his level becomes equal to the level of the monster. But unlike Link, Rhett is very weak. So he can not kill monsters consecutively. If he kills a monster, he can't kill the next monster and avoids it. However, he can wait until a high level monster appears and kill it, to maximize the XP gained. Find the Highest XP that Rhett can obtain.
