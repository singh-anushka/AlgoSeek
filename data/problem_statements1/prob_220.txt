Chef invented a new game named Quick Battle Royale. NN people play the game. One or more rounds are played until all players except one are eliminated. In each round:

Let there be xx non-eliminated players at the start of the round. Let's number them 11 through xx.
First, each of these players chooses an integer between 11 and xx inclusive. For each valid ii, let's denote the integer chosen by the ii-th player by pipi. In addition, each player is not allowed to choose pi=ipi=i. Under these conditions, all players choose uniformly randomly and independently.
Then, the elimination process starts. For each ii from 11 to xx, in this order:
if the player ii is currently still in the game, the player pipi is eliminated from the game immediately
if the player ii was already eliminated from the game in this round, nothing happens

Note that it is impossible for all players to be eliminated and in each round, at least one player is eliminated.
For example, a game for N=4N=4 could look like this:

Round 1: The players choose p1=3p1=3, p2=4p2=4, p3=2p3=2, p4=2p4=2. For i=1i=1, since player 11 is still in the game, player pi=3pi=3 is eliminated. For i=2i=2, since player 22 is also in the game, player pi=4pi=4 is eliminated. Since the players 33 and 44 are eliminated, nothing more happens.
Round 2: Two players remain. The only choice they have is p1=2p1=2 and p2=1p2=1. For i=1i=1, since player 11 is still in the game, player pi=2pi=2 gets eliminated. For i=2i=2, player 22 is eliminated, so nothing happens.

Now there is one player left, so the game ends. It lasted 22 rounds.
You have to find the expected value of the number of rounds the game will last. It can be shown that the expected number of rounds can be written as a fraction pqpq, where pp and qq are positive integers and qq is coprime with 109+7109+7. You have to compute p⋅q−1p⋅q−1 modulo 109+7109+7, where q−1q−1 is the multiplicative inverse of qq modulo 109+7109+7.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer NN denoting the number of players at the start of the game.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer p⋅q−1p⋅q−1 modulo 109+7109+7.

Explanation
Example case 3: The answer is 3232 modulo (109+7)(109+7). The following cases can happen in the first round (with equal probabilities):
    - p=[2,1,1]p=[2,1,1], game lasts 11 round
    - p=[2,1,2]p=[2,1,2], game lasts 22 rounds
    - p=[2,3,1]p=[2,3,1], game lasts 11 round 
    - p=[2,3,2]p=[2,3,2], game lasts 22 rounds
    - p=[3,1,1]p=[3,1,1], game lasts 11 round
    - p=[3,1,2]p=[3,1,2], game lasts 11 round
    - p=[3,3,1]p=[3,3,1], game lasts 22 rounds
    - p=[3,3,2]p=[3,3,2], game lasts 22 rounds
Example case 4: The answer is 35183518 modulo (109+7)(109+7).
