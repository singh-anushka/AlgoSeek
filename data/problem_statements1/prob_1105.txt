Ravi and vishal are playing Quiz in them, it's turn of vishal to ask question to Ravi,  so the question of Vishal is      " You have given n number of V shaped Rods.  you can arrange them in any way (two V shaped roads may or not intersect each other) you can bisect them or join them in a perpendicular or Parallel way. Your task is to answer maximum possible number of  region we can create by arranging n number of rods in different manners "  
So help Ravi to answer a question…. 
        ( check explanation for hint )
