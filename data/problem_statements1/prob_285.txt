Your friend works as a valet where NN cars show up in a shift. The ii-th car will arrive TiTi seconds after the current moment, and the car can wait for at most YiYi seconds. That is, your friend can only start parking the car from time TiTi to Ti+YiTi+Yi (inclusive).
Additionally, it takes XiXi time to park the ii-th car, which means he cannot park any other cars for XiXi seconds starting from the time he starts parking the ii-th car. It is known that no driver would like to wait for more time than it takes to park his car, so that Yi<XiYi<Xi for all ii. The driver of the ii-th car will pay AiAi coins as a tip to your friend if his car is parked. Note that he can start parking the next car immediately after he finishes parking the previous car.
Your friend has asked you what will be the maximize possible earnings if he optimally chooses which cars to park and at what times.
Input:

The first line contains one single integer NN (1≤N≤3⋅105)(1≤N≤3⋅105) −− the number of cars.
The second line contains NN integers T1,T2,…,TnT1,T2,…,Tn −− the time (in seconds) at which ii-th car arrives.
The third line contains NN integers X1,X2,…,XnX1,X2,…,Xn −− the time (in seconds) required to park the ii-th car.
The fourth line contains NN integers Y1,Y2,…,YnY1,Y2,…,Yn −− the maximum time (in seconds) for which the ii-th car can wait.
The fifth line contains NN integers A1,A2,…,AnA1,A2,…,An −− the tip which the ii-th car driver gives after the car is parked.

Output:
Print a single integer −− the answer to the problem.

Explanation
It is optimal to start parking the first car at 55 seconds. We finish parking at 88 seconds, and immediately start parking the second car.
