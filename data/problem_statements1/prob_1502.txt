Steve is in a fight with Hydra. He has nn gun shots. He has to kill the enemy in order to rule their territory. But, he can only fire 11 or 2 shots at each move. He also wants the number of moves to be a multiple of an integer k otherwise the gun will explode.
Help Steve to find the minimal number of moves to win the battle against Hydra by following the conditions given.

Input:
First line contains T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
Each testcase contains two space separated integers n, k.

*Note: Input file can be empty*

Output:
For each testcase, output an integer i.e. minimal number of moves being a multiple of kk. If there is no way he can win the battle by following the condition, print  −1-1.

Constraints
1≤T≤103
1≤n≤104
1≤k≤10

Subtasks
Subtask #1(100 points): Original Constraints

Sample Input:
2
10 2
3 5

Sample Output:
6
-1

EXPLANATION:
For the first case, Steve could win the battle in 6 moves with following sequence of steps: {2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1}. 
For the second test, there are only three valid sequence of steps {2, 1}, {1, 2}, {1, 1, 1} with 2, 2, and 3 steps respectively. All these numbers are not multiples of 5.
