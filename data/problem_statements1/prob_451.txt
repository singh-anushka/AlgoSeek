You are given N sets of integers A1,A2,…,AN. For each valid i, let's denote the elements of the set Ai by {ci,1,ci,2,…,ci,|Ai|}.
Find the number of ways to choose a sequence (a1,a2,…,aN) such that:

ai∈Ai for each valid i
ai≠ai+1 for each valid i and a1≠aN

Since this number may be large, compute it modulo 998,244,353.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer N.
N lines follow. For each valid i, the i-th of these lines contains an integer |Ai| followed by a space and |Ai| space-separated non-negative integers ci,1,ci,2,…,ci,|Ai|.

Output
Print a single line containing one integer ― the number of ways to choose (a1,a2,…,aN), modulo 998,244,353.
Constraints

2≤N≤200,000
|Ai|≥1 for each valid i
|A1|+|A2|+…+|AN|≤200,000
1≤ci,j≤200000 for each valid i,j
