You are given two numbers NN and MM. A pair of arrays (A,B) is called K-beautiful if and only if:

|A|=|B|=N (i.e. both their lengths are equal to N)
For all i such that 1≤i≤N, 0≤Ai≤M and 0≤Bi≤M.
mex(A)≤mex(B)
A is lexicographically smaller than B
The first index i where Ai<Bi is K

For each K (1≤K≤N), find the number of K-beautiful pairs and print those values modulo MOD.
Note: An array X is lexicographically smaller than Y if an only if there exists some i such that Xi<Yi and Xj=Yj for 1≤j<i. Also, mex(X) denotes the minimum non-negative integer that does not occur in X
Input Format
The first and only line of input contains three integers N, M, MOD - the parameters defined in the statement.
Output Format
Output N integers such that the i-th value denotes the number of i-beautiful pairs modulo MOD.
Constraints

1≤N≤200
1≤M≤200
2≤MOD≤109

Explanation
All the arrays of length 2 with values in range [0,1] are : [0,0],[0,1],[1,0],[1,1]. These arrays can form the following beautiful pairs:

1-beautiful : ([0,1],[1,0]),([0,0],[1,0])
2-beautiful : ([0,1],[0,0])

Thus, we should print [2 mod 204789219, 1 mod 204789219] = [2,1]
