Given an array AA of length NN such that 1≤Ai≤N1≤Ai≤N and Ai≠i, ∀i∈[1,N]. 
Count the number of arrays B of length N such that ∀i∈[1,N]:

Bi≠BAi
1≤Bi≤M

Since the answer may be large, print it modulo 109+7.
Input Format

The first line contains a single integer T − the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
Each test case contains 2 lines of input:
The first line of each test case contains two space separated integers N, M.
The second line of each test case contains N space separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.

Output Format
For each test case, output a single integer on a newline - answer modulo 109+7.
Constraints

1≤T≤105
2≤N≤105
1≤M≤100
1≤Ai≤N,Ai≠i
Sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 106
