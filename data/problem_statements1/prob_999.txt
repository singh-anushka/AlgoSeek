Miku likes geometry. While solving few geometrical problems she got stuck on one, luckily for her Kiku came to rescue and solved her problem. Can you solve it too?
Given  a line y=mx+cy=mx+c, and a set of NN points on Cartesian plane in the form of (Xi , Yi) for each 1≤i≤N1≤i≤N. You have to find out the number of pair of points which upon joining will make a line segment that will intersect the given line.
Note : Do not consider those points which lie on the given line. 
Input

First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
For each test case, first line will contain three space separated integers N,m,c
Next N lines will contain two space separated integer Xi , Yi

Output
For each testcase, Print the number of pair of points which upon joining will make a line segment that will intersect the given line.
Constraints

1≤T≤100
1≤N≤105
|m|,|c|,|Xi|,|Yi|≤109
Sum of N over all testcases does not exceed 105. 

Sample Input
1
4 1 1
0 -10
9 10
-10 10
10 3  
Sample Output
2
Explanation
Since (9,10) lies on the given line y=x+1. We have two pair of points left (−10,10),(0,−10) and (−10,10),(10,3). Hence 2 is the answer.
