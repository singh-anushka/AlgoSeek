Jas and Ashish are the President and Vice-president of CSIT Party and are working hard to win the elections of Mirzapur.
There are N states in Mirzapur, whose vote counts on Day 0 are given. (count[0,….,n-1]) .
Next D days, either the vote count of a state gets updated, or the election commission wants Jas and Ashish to submit their Max-Potential Value.
Max-Potential =  maximum of gcd(count[i],count[j]), for all i, j.  (0≤i,j≤n−1,i≠j0≤i,j≤n−1,i≠j).
Mathematically, the two operations can be defined as:

[1 i x]: Update voteCount of state i to x. (count[i] = x). 
[2]: Output Max-Potential.

See the explanation of sample test cases, for more clarity.
Warning: Use Fast IO
Input

The first line contains space-separated integers N, D.
The second line contains N space-separated integers count[0],count[1] …count[n-1].
Next D line contains input corresponding to one of the operations mentioned below.
Operation 1:  1 i x (3 space-separarted integer)
Operation 2:  2

Output
For every Operation 2, output the Max-Potential on a new line.
Constraints

2≤N≤1000002≤N≤100000
1≤D≤1000000
1≤x,count[i]≤100000
0≤i≤n−1

Example Input
5 5
1 1 3 4 5
2
1 1 2
2
1 4 3
2

Example Output
1
2
3

EXPLANATION:

On Day 0, count = [1,1,3,4,5]
On Day 1, Max-Potential = 1, gcd of all pairs of states is 1.
On Day 2, count = [1,2,3,4,5]
On Day 3, Max-Potential = 2, gcd of states 1,3 is gcd(2,4) = 2.
On Day 4, count = [1,2,3,4,3]
On Day 5, Max-Potential = 3, gcd of states 2,4 is gcd(3,3) = 3.
