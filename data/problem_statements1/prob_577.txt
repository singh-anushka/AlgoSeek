Chef has list of all Fibonacci Numbers but in modulo 1013. This list in infinite. 
We know that Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1. So in this list each number apart from first two, is sum of previous two numbers modulo 1013.
ex : (a+b)mod 1013.

So beginning of the list looks like : 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...

Now you're given an integer n, find first occurrence of n in the given list. (0-indexed)

Input
First line contains an integer n- the number, which position in the list you should find. 
Output
Print a single integer- the first occurrence of the given number, if the number doesn't occur print -1. 
Constraints

1 ≤ n ≤ 1013

Example
Input:
13
Output:
7

Input:
377
Output:
14

Explanation
Case1. Position of 13 in the Fibonacci list is 7.
