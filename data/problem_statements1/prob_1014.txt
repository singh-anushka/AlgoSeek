Your little brother has made a program to divide two numbers, A/B that only supports integer output.
As he haven't handled any exceptions, the program will crash if any error occurs.
For  given two numbers, predict if his program will be safe after execution.  
Input
First line contain single integer T, No. of test case
Next line for every test case contain two numbers, A and B 
Output
Print "crash" (without quotes) if program crashes and "safe" (without quote) otherwise
Constraints
1 <= T <= 104
0 <= A <= 105
0 <= B <= 105
Sample Input
4
55 5
98 9
5 2
0 98  
Sample Output
safe
crash
crash
safe  
Explanation
98/9 and 5/2 generates fractional result, hence crash   
Note
25x time multiplier for Java due to slow I/O for this problem.
