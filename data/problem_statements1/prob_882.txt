A bulb company claims that the average lifetime of its bulbs is at least XX units.
The company ran a test on NN bulbs. You are given the lifetime of N−1 of these bulbs. What is the minimum non-negative integer value of lifetime the remaining bulb can have, such that the claim of the company holds true?
Input Format

The first line contains a single integer T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains two integers N and X - denoting the number of test bulbs and the minimum average lifetime of bulbs in the company's claim.
The second line of each test case contains N−1 space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN−1 denoting the lifetimes of N−1 of the test bulbs.

Output Format
For each testcase, output the minimum non-negative integer value of lifetime the remaining bulb can have such that the claim of the company holds true.

Explanation
Let Y denote the value of the lifetime of the remaining bulb.
Test case 1: The remaining bulb must have lifetime no less than 6 units. The average lifetime with Y=6 is (1+5+6)3=4≥X. It can be proven that for any non-negative integer value of Y<6 it is not possible to have an average lifeftime of at least X=4.
Test case 2: The average lifetime with Y=0 is (5+8+6+0)4=4.75≥X. Thus the minimum non negative value which satisfies the condition is Y=0.
