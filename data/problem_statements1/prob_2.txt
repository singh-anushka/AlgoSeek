Given an array A1,A2,...,ANA1,A2,...,AN, count the number of subarrays of array AA which are non-decreasing.
A subarray A[i,j]A[i,j], where 1≤i≤j≤N1≤i≤j≤N is a sequence of integers Ai,Ai+1,...,AjAi,Ai+1,...,Aj.
A subarray A[i,j]A[i,j] is non-decreasing if Ai≤Ai+1≤Ai+2≤...≤AjAi≤Ai+1≤Ai+2≤...≤Aj. You have to count the total number of such subarrays.
Input

The first line of input contains an integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer NN denoting the size of array.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers A1A1, A2A2, …, ANAN denoting the elements of the array.

Output
For each test case, output in a single line the required answer.

Explanation
Example case 1.
All valid subarrays are A[1,1],A[1,2],A[2,2],A[3,3],A[3,4],A[4,4]A[1,1],A[1,2],A[2,2],A[3,3],A[3,4],A[4,4].
Note that singleton subarrays are identically non-decreasing.
Example case 2.
Only single subarray A[1,1]A[1,1] is non-decreasing.
