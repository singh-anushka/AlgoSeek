Oliver and Nova are true lovers. Inspite of knowing that Nova will die Oliver married her at the lake where they met. But they had a conflict about even and odd numbers. Nova likes the odd numbers and Oliver prefers even. One day they went to a fair where Oliver bought some square shaped marshmallows and Nova bought some round shaped. Then they decided to play a game. They will pick a natural number N . Nova will sum up the odd numbers from 1 to N and and she will notedown LCM of R(R is defined in the picture) and the sum she calculated before. And Oliver will sum up the even numbers from 1 to N and and he will notedown LCM of S(S is defined in the picture) and the sum he calculated before. You must use the ceil value of R and S.

Now  whose LCM is strictly greater than the other will win.If both of their LCM is equal Nova will win because Oliver is afraid of Nova.
N.B.N.B. define the value of pi with acos(−1)acos(−1).
N.B.N.B. Sum of all odd number and sum of all even number will not exceed 10^18. 
Input:
The first line contains an integer TT  — the number of test cases in the input. Next, T test cases are given, one per line.
Each test case is a positive integer N  . 
Output:
Print T answers to the test cases.
In each test cases,
If Oliver wins the game, print "Nova's gonna kill me" (without quotes) .
If Nova wins the game, print "YESS(sunglass emo)" (without quotes) .
