Chef has a sequence A1,A2,…,AN. Let's define a function f(l,r) in the following way:

If 1≤l≤r≤N, then f(l,r) is the maximum of Al,Al+1,…,Ar.
Otherwise, f(l,r) is 0.

Chef wants to choose a subset S of the set of indices {1,2,…,N} such that |S|≥K. Let's define C=∑i∈S∑j∈Sf(i,j).
Can you help Chef find the smallest value of C he can get?
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and K.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the minimum value of C.
Constraints

1≤T≤1,000
1≤K≤N≤5,000
1≤Ai≤109 for each valid i
the sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 10,000
