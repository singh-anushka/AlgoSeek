You have been given an integer N.
An array(arr) is said to be good if its array value is found equal to N.
Array value =  ∑f(arr[i])
Here, f(x) is equal to number of integers k (1≤k≤x)  which gives GCD(k,x)=1
Print the good array to solve this task.
Note that  elements of array should be less than or equal to 1000000  (and greater than 0)  and should be unique
In case of multiple possible answers, you can output any of them.
Input:

It contains of a single integer N. 

Output:
In the first-line print size of the array or −1 in the case answer not exist.
In the second line print the goodarray if the answer exists.
Constraints

1≤N≤2∗105

Sample Input:
6

Sample Output:
2
3 8

EXPLANATION:
f(3) + f(8)  = 2 + 4 = 6
