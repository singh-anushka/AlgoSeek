You can only jump from step−(x)step−(x) to step−(x+1)step−(x+1), step−(x+2)step−(x+2), or step−(x+3)step−(x+3).
You have to solve tt cases.
In each case, you are given an integer nn. You have to find the number of ways to reach step−(n)step−(n), starting from step−(0)step−(0).
Input:

First line will contain tt, the number of test-cases.
Next tt lines, will contain an integer nn.

Output:
For each test-case, output the number of ways to reach step−(n)step−(n), starting from step−(0)step−(0).
Constraints:
