Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese and Russian.
Nobody knows, but NN frogs live in Chef's garden.
Now they are siting on the X-axis and want to speak to each other. One frog can send a message to another one if the distance between them is less or equal to KK.
Chef knows all PP pairs of frogs, which want to send messages. Help him to define can they or not!
Note : More than 11 frog can be on the same point on the X-axis.
Input

The first line contains three integers NN, KK and PP.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers A1A1, A2A2, …, ANAN denoting the x-coordinates of frogs".
Each of the next PP lines contains two integers AA and BB denoting the numbers of frogs according to the input.

Output
For each pair print "Yes" without a brackets if frogs can speak and "No" if they cannot.

Explanation

For pair (1,2)(1,2) frog 11 can directly speak to the frog 22 as the distance between them is 3−0=3≤K3−0=3≤K . 
For pair (1,3)(1,3) frog 11 can send a message to frog 22, frog 22 can send it to frog 44 and it can send it to frog 33.
For pair (2,5)(2,5) frogs can't send a message under current constraints.
