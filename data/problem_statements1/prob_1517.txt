You are provided four points pp on xx-axis, qq on y-axis, r(min - value on x-axis) and s(min - value on y-axis). Initially, p≥r and q≥s. You can perform the following operation less than or equal to n times:
Select either p or q and reduce it by 1. Where point p cannot become less than r, and point q cannot become less than s.
Find the minimum possible area under p,q(p⋅q) you can cover by applying the given operation less than or equal to n times.
Input:

First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
The only line of the test case contains 5 integer points p,q,r,s and n.

Output:

For each test case, print one integer: the minimum possible area under p and q(p⋅q) you can cover by applying the given operation less than or equal to n times.

Constraints

1≤T≤2⋅104
1≤p,q,r,s,n≤109
p≥r and q≥s

Sample Input:
    4
    10 11 2 1 5
    10 10 8 5 3
    12 8 8 7 2
    10 11 9 1 10

Sample Output:
    55
    70
    77
    10

EXPLANATION:

In the first test case, if you reduce p five times then only obtain 5⋅11=55.
In the second test case, if you reduce q three times then only obtain 10⋅7=70.
In the third test case, if you reduce b one time and q one time then only obtain 11⋅7=77.
In the fourth test case, if you reduce q ten times then only obtain 10⋅1=10.
