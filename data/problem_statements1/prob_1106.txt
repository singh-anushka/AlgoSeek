You are given an array of size N, consisting only of -1 and 1.Your task is to make the sum of the array equals to 0. To make the sum 0, you can do ONE of the following operation in EACH step.

Replace -1 by 1. 
Replace 1 by -1.  

Also, you will see that it's Not always possible to make the sum 0, if it's impossible to make the sum 0, print  −1 as a result.
Note: Array will only contain −1 and +1 as the elements.
Input:

First line of input will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
First line of each testcase contains single integer N. 
Second line of each test case contains N space separated integers, elements of the array. 

Output:
For each testcase, output a single line integer, minimum number of steps required to make sum 0, or print -1 if it's impossible to make the sum 0.
Constraints

1≤T≤10
1≤N≤105

Sample Input:

8
-1 -1 -1 1 -1 1 1 -1  
Sample Output:

EXPLANATION:
Case #1 : the sum is already 0, so you don't need to perform any step.  
Case #2 : number of '+1' is 3 and number of '-1' is 2, whatever steps you may perform you cannot make sum equals to 0.  
Case #3 : number of '+1' is 4 and number of '-1' is 0, so you can replace two '+1' by '-1' in two steps. So, finally there are two '+1' and two '-1' in the array, whose the sum is 0.   
Case #4 : number of '+1' is 3, and number of '-1' is 5, so after replacing one '-1' by '+1', we will get four '-1' and four '+1', whose sum is 0.
