Given the number of classes attended(NANA) and a total number of classes conducted(NCNC). Let P be the percentage of attendance. Its status needs to be printed as below.

.
90≤P≤10090 \leq P \leq 100=Very Good
80≤P≤8980 \leq P \leq 89=Good
75≤P≤7975 \leq P \leq 79=Average
P<75P < 75=Danger

Input:


First line contains number of test cases(T).
