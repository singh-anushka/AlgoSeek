There are NN players participating in a knockout tournament. The ii-th player has the rating Ai. No two players have the same rating.
N−1 matches are played in the tournament. In each match, 2 random players are chosen out of the remaining players, and the player with the higher rating wins. The losing player gets eliminated from the tournament.
Can you find out the expected rating of the player ending up at the second position (that is, the expected rating of the player losing in the (N−1)-th match)? 
The expected rating of the second player can be represented as a fraction of the form PQ. You are required to print P⋅Q−1(mod1000000007). 
Input Format

The first line contains T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains N - the number of players participating in the tournament.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,⋯,AN - the ratings of the players.

Output Format
For each test case, output on a single line the expected rating of the second player modulo 1000000007.
Constraints

2≤N≤5⋅105
1≤Ai≤109
Ai≠Aj for all 1≤i<j≤N

Explanation

Test Case 1: There is only one possible match, and the player with rating =1 will be the second player.
Test Case 2: The player with rating =1 will be the second player with probability 13. The player with rating =2 will be the second player with probability 23. Therefore, the expected rating of the second player is 1⋅13+2⋅23=53.
