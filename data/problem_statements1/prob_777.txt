The next jump takes you to a bizarre yet familiar group of islands. You walk up to Prof Paradox and you get to know about a recent reverse-engineering debacle that brought back the Dinosaurs. These Dinosaurs escaped from their captivity and now are set to destroy the group of islands. 
Each island has a defense power of AiAi. Some of these islands are connected with a bridge. The total power of the connected islands is the sum of each of their individual defense powers. 
To battle the dinosaurs, you need all the defense that you can get. But, the mad scientist refuses to link all the connected islands, owing to the years of arch enmity between these groups and simply because he doesn’t want to.
With every peace treaty between two groups, the total defense power is the product of their individual defense powers. 
Can you convince the islanders to join hands against the dinosaurs by showing them the total power they can hold?
Since the results can be large, output result modulo 1000000007 (109+7109+7).
Input:

First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
First line of each testcase contains of a single line of input, two integers N,M where N 
denotes the number of islands and M denotes the number of bridges.
Next line contains N spaced integers denoting the defense value of each island.
Then M lines follow, each containing, two integers u and v indicating that there is a 
bridge between island u and island v.

Output:
For each testcase, output in a single line the total power modulo 1000000007.

3 2
2 3 9 
1 2
3 1

Sample Output:
14

EXPLANATION:
All the Islands are connected, Hence the defense power value is the sum of all powers,
i.e; 2+3+9=14
