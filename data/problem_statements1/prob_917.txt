Consider a sequence A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN, where initially, Ai=iAi=i for each valid i. You may perform any number of operations on this sequence (including zero). In one operation, you should choose two valid indices i and j, compute the greatest common divisor of Ai and Aj (let's denote it by g), and change both Ai and Aj to g.
You are given a sequence B1,B2,…,BN. Is it possible to obtain this sequence, i.e. change A to B, using the given operations?
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers B1,B2,…,BN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing the string "YES" if it is possible to obtain A=B or "NO" if it is impossible.
Constraints

1≤N≤104
1≤Bi≤i for each valid i
the sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 105

Subtasks
Subtask #1 (10 points): N≤4
Subtask #2 (20 points): there is at most one valid index p such that Bp≠p
Subtask #3 (70 points): original constraints

                        Sample Output 1
                        





NO
YES


Explanation
Example case 1: We cannot make the third element of the sequence (1,2,3) become 2.
Example case 2: We can perform one operation with (i,j)=(2,4), which changes the sequence (1,2,3,4) to (1,2,3,2).
