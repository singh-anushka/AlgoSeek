 They can be represented as sum of two or more consecutive positive integers.  
I will name this condition as 'beautiful' in further statement. 

For instance, 10 can be represented as sum of 1+2+3+4. 

Given an integer N, find XOR of Nth integer that satisfies the beautiful condition with the maximum number smaller than this Nth integer that does not satisfy beautiful condition. 
For instance, if N is 1, then 1st number in the set of integers that satisfies beautiful condition is 3. The maximum number smaller than 3 that does not satisfy the condition is 2. XOR of 3 and 2 is 1. 
Please note that value of Nth number won't exceed 600 in this problem. 
Input : 

First line will contain TT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
Each testcase contains of a single integer NN. 

Output : 
For each testcase, output a single integer, according to the query asked above. 

Constraints
1≤T≤101 \leq T \leq 10

6
Explanations :
Case #1Case #1 : Explained in problem statement. 
Case #2Case #2 :  The second integer that satisfies the condition is 5. The greatest number smaller than 5 that does not satisfy beautiful condition is 4. XOR of 5 and 4 is 1.
Case #3Case #3 :  The first 10 integers that satisfy beautiful condition are 3,5,6,7,9,10,11,12,13,14.  
The 10th integer that satisfies the condition is 14. The greatest number smaller than 14 that does not satisfy is 8. XOR of 14 and 8 is 6.
