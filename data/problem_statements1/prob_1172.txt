You are given a list AA of length NN of non-negative integers. You need to find the length of the longest subsequence of A such that the binary representation  of bitwise and of all of its elements contains at least K set bits.
Input Format

First-line contains the number of test cases T. Then the test cases follow.
Each of the test cases contains two lines. First-line contains two space-separated integers N and K. The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2...AN.

Output Format
For each test case, output in a single line the length of the desired subsequence.
Constraints

1≤T≤1000
1≤N≤105
0≤K<8
0≤Ai<128
It is guaranteed that the sum of N over all the testcases does not exceed 105.
