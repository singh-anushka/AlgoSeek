    You are given a string S and you want to make it (n,k) special. String A is (n,k) 
    special if after concatenating n copies of string A we get at least k substring 
    of A in the resulting string (Overlapping substrings also count). Your task is to find the minimum number of characters you need to 
    alter to make string S, (n,k) special.


Note : Inputs are given such that it is always possible to get at least k substrings.



 Input 

The first line contains a single integer T, which denotes the number 
        of test cases. The description of each test case follows. 
    
 The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k.
    

        The second line of each test case contains the string S. 
    


 Output 
    For each test case, Output minimum number of characters you need to alter 
    to make string SS, (n,k)(n,k) special.


Constraints 

 1≤T≤2010 
 1≤|S|≤105 
 1≤n≤105 
 1≤k≤1010 
 The sum of |S| over all test cases does not exceed 105
