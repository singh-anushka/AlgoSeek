Mr. Vasu being one of the top coders in his college was given the responsibility to organize a coding contest for NIT Kurukshetra’s tech festival. Although he was very good at solving questions, he found that it was a much harder task to make questions. The contest’s date was coming close and he couldn’t come up with any problems. Finally, Mr. Vasu decides to copy questions from a website to make the contest (not a decision he was very proud of).
The website has NN number of questions. Each of the questions has a difficulty rating associated with it. The ith question has a difficulty Di. You are given a list of the difficulty rating of all the questions. Vasu has to select Q questions out of them (2≤Q≤N). He wants the minimum rating difference between any two questions out of all the questions that he selected should be maximized.
Input:

The first line contains a single integer N, denoting the number of questions
The second line contains Q which denotes the number of questions Vasu has to pick.
The third line contains N space-separated integers in ascending order denoting the difficulty rating of the question.

Output:
Print the largest minimum rating difference between any two questions selected by Vasu.
