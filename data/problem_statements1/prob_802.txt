It is time for the final face-off. Now Batman must travel to where Superman is waiting as soon as possible. However, it happens that a road maintenance task is currently underway in Metropolis. Batman knows that the city policy dictates only one road can be repaired at a time. So he must come up with the shortest route quickly as soon as he learns which road is being repaired.
The city is designed as a graph having 'V' vertices and 'E'  bidirectional roads. Batman starts from one of these vertices and his destination is also one of these vertices.
Input
• The first line of the input is T number of test cases. T test cases follow.
•For each test case, the first line contains 2 space separated integers V and E.
•The next E lines follow, each containing 3 space separated integers u, v, w, where u and v denote the
vertices connected by a road and w being the length of the road. u and v will always be different.
•The next line contains 2 space separated B and S, denoting the vertices of Batman and Superman's
position respectively.
•The next line contains a single integer Q denoting the number of queries
•The next Q lines each contain two integers u and v, denoting that the road connect u and v is
under maintenance.

Output
•For each query, output a single line containing the minimum distance Batman needs to travel to get to his
destination. If it is impossible to do so, output -1.
