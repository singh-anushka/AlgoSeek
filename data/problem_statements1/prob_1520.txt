The park is a 2 dimensional space with roads occupying some of its squares, such as the one shown in the figure below. The naming conventions are Cartesian with the origin square being named as (0,0). Afzal needs to clean the park with the following constraints: -



He has t minutes of time in which he can clean as much as possible.
He has a vacuum cleaner which is fully charged with c units.
There is only one charging point in the park which is at this starting square, say (x,y).
Cleaning each square consumes 40 units of charge and 5 minutes of time.
Moving from one square to its adjacent requires no units of charge and 2 minutes of time.
If the charge left in the vacuum cleaner is less than 40, the square cannot be cleaned. In this case, he will have to back to his starting point for charging and the time required for charging is 20 minutes.
Afzal can move his cleaner only on the roads of the park.

You need to find out the maximum number of squares that can be cleaned in this time interval.

 
Input

The first line of input will contain a single integer n denoting number of squares filled by the roads.
The second line will contain the integer t denoting total available time.
The third line will contain the integer c denoting the total charge.
The fourth line will contain the co-ordinates of the start square in the form 'i j' which refers to the (i,j)th square.
The next n lines will contain the co-ordinates of the squares in the form 'i j' which refers to the (i,j)th square.

Output

Output will contain a single integer denoting the number of squares cleaned.

Constraints


1 ≤ t ≤ 1000
1 ≤ c ≤ 1000
Maximum area of the park will be 256 x 256.

Explanation
Example case 1.
The example is same as the image shown above.
At t=0, he is at (5,0).
At t=5, he cleans (5,0), rem. charge is 60.
At t=6, he is at (5,1).
At t=11, he cleans (5,1), rem. charge is 20.
At t=12, he is again at (5,0) to charge.
At t=32, he completes charging.
At t=34, he is at (5,2).
At t=39, he cleans (5,2), rem. charge is 60.
At t=45, he cleans (5,3), rem. charge is 20.
At t=48, he is at the starting pt. (5,0) for charging.
At t=68, charging gets complete.
However, only 2 minutes are remaining and no square can be cleaned now; hence, the output, 4.
