The chef is owning a team and participating in an upcoming tournament.
There are NN teams in the tournament apart from Chef’s team and Chef’s team plays against each of these NN teams exactly once. The point system in the tournament is weird. If a team wins a match it will receive k points where k is the number of matches the team has played till then including the current one. Each team[i] has a power value P[i]  and the power of the chef’s team is M. A team with greater power value will always beat a team with smaller power values. Since Chef is creating the schedule for the tournament. He wants to make his team get the maximum points possible. Find the maximum points that the chef's team gets mod 1000000007.
Input:

First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
The first line of each testcase contains N and M the number of teams and power value of the Chef’s team.
The second line of each testcase contains N space separated integers, namely P1,P2,…PN.

Output:
For each testcase, output in a single integer the maximum points Chef’s team can get.
Constraints :

1≤T≤100
1≤N≤100000
1≤M≤109
1≤Pi≤109
Each element in P is pairwise distinct and not equal to M

Sample Input:
1
3 5
6 3 4

Sample Output:
5

EXPLANATION:
Chef’s team can play in the same order as input and receive 5 points by beating two teams in second match and third match respectively.
