You're given a simple undirected graph GG with NN vertices and M edges. You have to assign, to each vertex i, a number Ci such that 1≤Ci≤N and ∀i≠j,Ci≠Cj.
For any such assignment, we define Di to be the number of neighbours j of i such that Cj<Ci. 
You want to minimise maxi∈{1..N}Di−mini∈{1..N}Di.
Output the minimum possible value of this expression for a valid assignment as described above, and also print the corresponding assignment.
Note: 

The given graph need not be connected.
If there are multiple possible assignments, output anyone. 
Since the input is large, prefer using fast input-output methods.

Input Format

First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
The first line of each test case contains two integers N,M - the number of vertices and edges in the graph respectively.
The next M lines each contain two integers - X,Y, denoting that there exists an edge between vertex X and vertex Y.

Output Format
The output of each test case consists of two lines:

The first line contains the minimum possible value of the expression described above.
The second line contains N space separated integers - the ith of which is Ci in the corresponding assignment.

Constraints

1≤T≤1000
1≤N,M≤3⋅105
1≤X≠Y≤N
The sum of N across test cases does not exceed 3⋅105.
The sum of M across test cases does not exceed 3⋅105.

Explanation
Test Case 1: The following assignment is optimal:

C1=1
C2=2
C3=3
C4=4
C5=5

We can see that 3 has two neighbours with smaller values - 1 and 2. Vertex 5 is also its neighbour, but has a larger value. Therefore, D3=2. 
Similarly, we can calculate:

D1=0
D2=1
D3=2
D4=2
D5=2

Therefore, maxi∈{1..N}Di−mini∈{1..N}Di = 2−0 = 2. 
Test Case 2: The following assignment is optimal:

C1=5
C2=3
C3=1
C4=2
C5=4

The values of D are:

D1=1
D2=1
D3=0
D4=1
D5=1

Therefore, maxi∈{1..N}Di−mini∈{1..N}Di = 1−0 = 1.
