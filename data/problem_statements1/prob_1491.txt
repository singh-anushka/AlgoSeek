In the end part of the show ,  the presenter writes a number of N digits in a board. The participant must then erase exactly M digits from the number in the board; the number formed by the remaining digits is the value of the money prize for the participant. As a very good programmer Asif is obvious going to take the highest value from it . Can you tell the highest value of prize Asif is going to take . 
 
Input
The first line contains an integer T i.e. the number of Test cases. T test cases follow. Each test case has 2 lines. The first line contains N( number of digits the presenter writes in the black board ) and  M (the number of digits that must be erased.).The second line contains n digits of number and the number doesn’t start with zero .

Output
For each test case, print a line “Case x: y” where x is replaced by the test case number and y is  the highest prize Asif  can win.

Constraints

1 <= T <=  100
1 <=  N  <=  1000 
1 <=  M  <=  N - 1 

Example
Input:
