You have a 1XN1XN checker board, an infinite supply of 1X11X1 dominos available in 3 different colours - red, green & blue, an infinite supply of 1X2 dominos available in 2 different colours - black and white. You have to figure out the number of distinct ways in which you can tile the checker board using dominos.
Hint: The number of ways to tile Tn can be modelled by the recurrence relation Tn=3∗Tn−1+2∗Tn−2
Input:

First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
Each testcase contains of a single line of input, one integer N. 

Output:
For each testcase, output in a single line the number of distinct ways to cover the checker board using dominoes modulo 1000000007.

EXPLANATION:
Case 1: 1X2 checker board can be tiled these 11 combinations:
(Red, Red)
(Red, Green)
(Red, Blue)
(Green, Red)
(Green, Green)
(Green, Blue)
(Blue, Red)
(Blue, Green)
(Blue, Blue)
(Black)
(White)
Case 2: 1X1 checker board can be tiled these 3 combinations:
(Red)
(Green)
(Blue)
Case 3: 1X5 checker board can be tiled by 495 combinations, one such tiling is:
(White, Red, White)
