You are given NN intervals [L1,R1],[L2,R2],…,[LN,RN][L1,R1],[L2,R2],…,[LN,RN]. Consider N integers x1,x2,…,xN such that:

xi∈[Li,Ri] for each valid i
all decimal digits of S=x1+x2+x3+…+xN (without leading zeroes) lie between A and B inclusive

In how many different ways can you pick the sequence x1,x2,…,xN? Since this number may be very large, compute it modulo 109+7.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers N, A and B.
N lines follow. For each i (1≤i≤N), the i-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers Li and Ri.

Output
For each test case, print a single line contains one integer — the number of ways to choose x1,x2,…,xN, modulo 109+7.
Constraints

1≤T≤200
1≤N≤7
0≤A≤B≤9
0≤Li≤Ri<109 for each valid i
if T>1, then N≤3
