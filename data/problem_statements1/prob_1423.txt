Chef had a sequence S0,S1,…,SN−1S0,S1,…,SN−1; each element of this sequence was an integer between 00 and N−1 (inclusive). Unfortunately, he forgot some (possibly zero or all) elements of this sequence. You are given a sequence A0,A1,…,AN−1, where for each valid i, Ai=−1 denotes an element Chef forgot and if Ai≠−1, then Ai=Si.
Before Chef forgot any elements of S, he created a sequence B0,B1,…,BN−1, where for each valid i, Bi is the number of occurrences of the value i in S (the number of valid indices j such that Sj=i), and then, he created a third sequence G0,G1,…,GN, where for each valid i, Gi is the number of occurrences of the value i in B. (Note that the elements of B are between 0 and N inclusive.) Unfortunately, Chef also forgot the sequence B, but he remembers G.
Help Chef restore the missing elements of the sequence S. Precisely, find the lexicographically smallest sequence S which is consistent with all the given information or determine that there is no such sequence.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A0,A1,…,AN−1.
The third line contains N+1 space-separated integers G0,G1,…,GN.

Output
For each test case:

If there is no sequence S consistent with all the given information, print a single line containing the string "impossible".
Otherwise, print a single line containing N space-separated integers S0,S1,…,SN−1 - the lexicographically smallest valid sequence S.

Constraints

1≤T≤1,000
2≤N≤105
−1≤Ai≤N−1 for each valid i
