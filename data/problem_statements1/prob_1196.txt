Ankit has to submit his assignment given by his master. But Ankit's friends are calling him again and again to play cricket, and Ankit couldn't resist himself from playing cricket. So could you help him solving the problem?
Formally, you are given a sequence of N positive integers: B=(B1,B2,B3,B4,...,Bn) and Q Queries.
In the ith query, (1≤i≤Q), given a positive integer Ai find the Aith smallest integer among the positive integers that differ from all of the B1,B2,...,Bn.
