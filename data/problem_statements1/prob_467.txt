Satkkeerthi has decided to participate in the Game of Stones. There are nn cities numbered 1 to n and m directed
roads between the cities. 
There is an infinitely large pile of stones in each city, of one particular colour. Each colour is described by a colour code, ai at the ith city.  
A player must choose a path starting from one city, and at every city along the path, he/she adds one stone to the collection at hand. The score of a player is defined as the maximum number of stones collected of a particular colour. Help Satkkeerthi maximize his score and be declared the bearer of an aptronym!
Input:
The first line of input contains two integers n,m,the number of cities and the number of roads connecting them, respectively.
The second line contains n integers separated by a space, ai denoting the colour code of the stone at city i.
Then m lines follow, where each line contains two integers x and y, indicating that there is a directed road from city x to city y. We remind you that x and y may be equal, and do not guarantee complete connectivity of all cities.
Output:
Print a single integer, the maximum score which Satkkerthi can achieve. If his score can be arbitrarily large, print -1.
Constraints:

1≤n,m≤105
1≤colourcode≤100
1≤x,y≤n

Sample input:
 5 6
 1 2 1 2 2
 1 2
 1 3
 1 4
 2 3
 4 5
 5 2

Sample Output:
   3

Explanation:
The path 4----2-----5 contains 3 stones of colour 2 and is thus the maximum score that can be obtained.
