Ready for another Assignment? But don't worry this one is easy.
Remember how we used to convert numbers in p/q form to decimal form in Number System?
Let's do it again !
A number will be given to you in form of p/q where p and q are positive integers. Your task is to convert this expression into decimal form.
if you get 10/2 as an input expression, it's decimal conversion will be 5.
or for 3/5 decimal conversion is 0.6.
Told you it's easy one.
But the Problem begins now.
If the solution has recurring decimals (Repeating recursively) then denote the repeating decimals by enclosing them between "[ ]";
for 2/3 decimal conversion will be 0.66666….infinitely.   so print the solution as 0.[6];
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.
The description of T test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains a single String S in form of "p/q".  
Output
For each test case, print a single line.
if the decimal is non-repeating recursively then print solution in decimal form and then "regular" ( without quotes) .
if the decimal is repeating recursively then print solution in decimal form and then  "vinculum" ( without quotes) .  
Constraints
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= p,q <= 10^5
Sample Input
2
2/5
8/3  
Sample Output
0.4  regular
2.[6]  vinculum 
Explanation
sample case 2 : As dividing 8 by 3 we get output as 2.66666….. .Here 6 is repeating recursively. So, 6 is enclosed in "[ ]".
