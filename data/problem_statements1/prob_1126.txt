Motherboard, the evil mother of our Farzi coder has gifted him an Array A[] of size N. She wanted to test the coding skills of her son. So she asked him Q questions of the form: given three integers (L, R, K), find number of special subsets of size K of the subarray A[L], A[L+1], .... A[R]. A set is special, if the greatest number which can divide all the elements of the set is 1.
    

        Please help our Farzi Coder in solving the task. As the answer can be large, print it modulo 10^9+7.
    
Input

		The first line of each file has the integer N denoting the size of array.
	

		Next line contains N space separated integers.
	

		Next line contains one integer Q denoting the number of queries on the array.
	

		Next Q lines contain 3 space separated integers each, "L R K" (without quotes).
	
Output

		For each query, print the required answer.
	
Constraints
1 ≤ N ≤ 50000
1 ≤ L ≤ R ≤ N
1 ≤ Q ≤ 50000
1 ≤ A[i] ≤ 100000
1 ≤ K ≤ R - L + 1

	Explanation
For query 1, the special sets of size 2 between the indices 1 and 5 are: {1, 2} {1, 3} {1, 4} {1, 5} {2, 3} {2, 5} {3, 4} {3, 5} {4, 5}
