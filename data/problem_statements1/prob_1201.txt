Given a positive integer number NN and non-negative integer K. A conversion can be applied to N that has two parts described as:

First the bits from the rightmost set bit till the end are flipped.
Then K is subtracted from the above new number.

You need to tell the smallest non-negative number that will be left if the above conversion is applied repeatedly and also the number of conversions.
Input:

Single line which contains space-separated N, K.

Output:
For each test case, output space-separated smallest number and number of conversion
Constraints

1≤N≤1012
0≤K≤1012

Subtasks

Subtask #1(10 points): 1≤N,K≤200
Subtask #2(90 points): Original Constraints

Sample Input:
4 2

Sample Output:
1 1

EXPLANATION:

4 in bits-> 100
2 in bits -> 010

Conversion:

Flipping: 100 -> 011
Subtracting: 011−010=001
After applying 1 conversion result becomes 1. If we apply it again on 1 then the result will be negative, Thus the answer is 1 1 smallest number and number of conversions respectively.
