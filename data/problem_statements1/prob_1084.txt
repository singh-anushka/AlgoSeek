Next t lines containing strings containing not more than 100 real numbers with maximum 6 digits after
decimal point.
Each real number is separated by character 'e'.
 
Output
Print sum of all real numbers as a output in different t lines. Print sum with 4 digits after decimal
point.
 
Constraints
0<= t <=1000

­-10^10 <= Real Numbers <= 10^10
 
Example
Input:
2
3e5.5e6.0001e7
1e6.6e7e8
