You are given an integer sequence A1,A2,…,AN. Find the number of integer sequences X1,X2,…,XN such that

0≤Xi<239 for each valid i
Xi≠Xj for each valid i≠j
(X1⋅A1)+(X2⋅A2)+…+(XN⋅AN) is divisible by 239

Since the answer may be large, compute it modulo 998,244,353.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.

Output
Print a single line containing one integer ― the number of sequences satisfying all conditions modulo 998,244,353.
Constraints

1≤N≤20
0≤Ai<239 for each valid i
