There are two teams (Team AA and Team B) playing a tournament of N matches of football against each other. Some of the matches are already completed and some are yet to be played. You are given a string S of length N representing the results of the N matches for Team A. The result of the ith match can be represented by one of the following:

W− Team A won the match. A win adds 3 points to the score of Team A and 0 points to the score of Team B
D− Team A drew the match with Team B. A draw adds 1 point to the score of both teams.
L− Team A lost the match. A loss adds 0 points to the score of Team A and 3 points to the score of Team B
?− The match is yet to be played.

After all the matches are played, the team with the highest score wins the tournament.
Team A has hired a very experienced coach for the remaining matches. Now, because of the coach's training, the team can get any result they want (win/draw/lose) for the remaining matches. 
Your task is to tell the minimum number of remaining matches Team A must win to make sure they win the tournament (i.e., the final score of Team A must be strictly greater than the final score of Team B).
Input:

First line will contain T, the number of test cases. Then T the test cases follow. 
First line of each test case contains a single integer N.
Second line of each test case contains a string S of length N.

Output:
For each test case, output in a single line the minimum number of remaining matches Team A must win. If it is not possible for Team A to win the tournament output "-1".
