Alice thought of a function FF, which takes an arbitrary array of integers A=(A1,A2,…,AM)A=(A1,A2,…,AM) as the only argument and is defined in the following way:

Consider all pairs of subarrays (Ai,Ai+1,…,Aj)(Ai,Ai+1,…,Aj) and (Ak,Ak+1,…,Al)(Ak,Ak+1,…,Al) such that:
1≤i≤j<k≤l≤M1≤i≤j<k≤l≤M
both subarrays are non-decreasing
Aj≤AkAj≤Ak
If there is no such pair of subarrays, F(A)=0F(A)=0.
Otherwise, F(A)F(A) is the maximum of the expression (j−i+1)+(l−k+1)(j−i+1)+(l−k+1) over all such pairs of subarrays.

In other words, you need to choose two non-overlapping non-empty subarrays of AA and concatenate them in the same order; the resulting array should be non-decreasing and F(A)F(A) is its maximum possible length.
Bob challenged Alice to solve the following problem and she needs your help.
You are given a tree with NN vertices (numbered 11 through NN), rooted at the vertex 11. There is an integer written in each vertex; for each valid ii, let's denote the integer written in vertex ii by ViVi. You should choose one vertex ― let's denote it by vv. Then, consider an array AA containing values which are written in vertices on the path from the root to vv (inclusive), in this order, and calculate F(A)F(A). Find the maximum possible value of F(A)F(A) which you can obtain this way.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers V1,V2,⋅,VNV1,V2,⋅,VN.
Each of the following N−1N−1 lines contains two space-separated integers uu and vv denoting that vertices uu and vv are connected by an edge.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the maximum of F(A)F(A).

Explanation
Example case 1: We choose v=3v=3. Then, A(3)=(2,5)A(3)=(2,5); its subarrays (2)(2) and (5)(5) satisfy all required conditions and the sum of their lengths is 22. There is no way to get a greater value of the function FF.
