In this question you only need to print a sequence S of length N which fulfills the given constraints.

 Given a number H , the HCF ( S0, S1, S2, .... ,Si, ..... ,SN-1 ) = H and Si > H , ∀ 0 ≤ i < N.
 Si ≤ Si+1, ∀ 0 ≤ i < N-1
 The value of the function sum(S) = S0 + S1 + .... + SN-1 should be the least.

Input

First line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
Next T lines follow. The ith line will contain two spaced separate integers H and N for the ith test case.

Output
For each test case, print a line containing N space separated integers of sequence S.
Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 103
1 ≤ H ≤ 1014
1 ≤ N ≤ 103

Example
Input :
1
1 2

Output :
2 3
