You are given a full binary tree of height n. Node 1 is the root, and for i≤2n−1−1, node i is the parent of node 2i and node 2i+1. For each node i, there is a positive integer ai written on it.
A primeful cycle is a group of k>2 nodes x1,x2,…,xk such that:

k is a prime number,
gcd(ax1,ax2) mod k= gcd(ax2,ax3) mod k=…= gcd(axk−1,axk) mod k= gcd(axk,ax1) mod k .

Let the height of each node be 1 plus the distance from that node to node 1. Note that by this definition, the height of node 1 is 1. Let the beauty value of a primeful cycle of nodes be the sum of the height of each node.
There are q queries. In each query, you are given a node x. Considering all the nodes in the subtree of node x (including node x), find the smallest possible beauty value of a primeful cycle of nodes taken from these nodes only. If there is no such group, print −1 instead.
Input:

The first line contains two integers, n and q.
The second line contains 2n−1 integers, a1,a2,…,a2n−1.
The third line contains q integers, the i-th of which is the integer x for the i-th query. 

Output:
For each test case, print a single line containing the answer to the test case. Print the answer to the test cases on separate lines.
