Given a sequence AA of length NN and an integer M, such that the elements of A are pairwise distinct.
For each k (1≤k≤M), find the number of subsequences Ai1,Ai2,…,Aip of A satisfying the following conditions:

Condition 1: ∑pj=1Aij=k.
Condition 2: Let f(l,r)=maxri=lAi. Then, for each j (1≤j≤p−1), f(ij,ij+1)>max(Aij,Aij+1) holds.
If p=1 (subsequence is of length 1), this condition is considered to be true.

Find the number of subsequences satisfying both the conditions for each k (1≤k≤M). Since the answer can be huge, print it modulo 998244353.
Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.

Explanation
Test Case 1: 

k=1: The only subsequence satisfying both the conditions is {1}.  

The sum of all elements of this subsequence is 1.  
Since there is only one element in the subsequence, we consider the second condition to be true.
k=2: The only subsequence satisfying both the conditions is {2}.  

The sum of all elements of this subsequence is 2.  
Since there is only one element in the subsequence, we consider the second condition to be true.
k=3: The subsequences satisfying both the conditions are {3} and {2,1}. For the subsequence {2,1}:

The sum of all elements of this subsequence is 2+1=3.  
There are 2 elements in the subsequence. The indices of these elements in the sequence are 1 and 5 respectively. Here, f(1,5)=max5i=1Ai=5 and max(2,1)=2. Thus, f(1,5)>max(A1,A5).
k=4: The subsequences satisfying both the conditions are {4} and {3,1}. For the subsequence {3,1}:

The sum of all elements of this subsequence is 3+1=4.  
There are 2 elements in the subsequence. The indices of these elements in the sequence are 3 and 5 respectively. Here, f(3,5)=max5i=3Ai=5 and max(3,1)=3. Thus, f(3,5)>max(A3,A5).
k=5: The subsequences satisfying both the conditions are {3}, {4,1} and {2,3}. For the subsequence {2,3}:

The sum of all elements of this subsequence is 2+3=5.  
There are 2 elements in the subsequence. The indices of these elements in the sequence are 1 and 3 respectively. Here, f(1,3)=max3i=1Ai=4 and max(2,3)=3. Thus, f(1,3)>max(A1,A3).
k=6: The only subsequence satisfying both the conditions is {2,3,1}.  

The sum of all elements of this subsequence is 2+3+1=6.  
There are 3 elements in the subsequence. The indices of these elements in the sequence are 1,3 and 5 respectively. Here, f(1,3)=max3i=1Ai=4 and max(2,3)=3. Thus, f(1,3)>max(A1,A3). Similarly, f(3,5)=max5i=3Ai=5 and max(3,1)=3. Thus, f(3,5)>max(A3,A5).
