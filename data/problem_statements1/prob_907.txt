You are given an array AA of length NN. Find the number of pairs of indices (i,j) such that

1≤i<j≤N
Ai⋅Aj>0

Input Format

The first line contains a single integer T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains an integer N - the size of the array A.
The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN denoting the array A.

Output Format
For each test case, output the number of pairs which satisfy the above conditions.
Constraints

1≤T≤1000
2≤N≤105
−104≤Ai≤104
Sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105
