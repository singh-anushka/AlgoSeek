It's the year $2050!$, and the war has begun between aliens and humans. The aliens have 
placed mines in the battlefield, where the battlefield can be described as grid of
size $n*m$, where $n$ denotes the number of rows numbered from $1$ to $n$ from top to bottom and $m$ denotes the number of columns numbered from $1$ to $m$ from left to right.
However, the human army knows the positions of the mines denoted by ($x$,$y$) in the field
and you being the commander have been assigned a task.
The task is described as follows:
Given the number of mines $x$ $(1 \leq x \leq n*m)$ and their respective positions in the grid consisting
of binary values $0$ or $1$, where a value of $1$ in cell ( $i$ , $j$ ) ( $1 \leq i \leq n , 1 \leq j \leq m$ ) denotes the presence of mine at 
position ($i$,$j$) and a value of $0$ in cell ($i$,$j$) denotes that the cell is free.
Since the mines are quite heavy, the operation of relocating a mine is described as moving a 
mine to either of its neighbouring side cells or leaving the mine in its current position only, 
but you can only perform this operation once for every $ith$ mine $1 \leq i \leq x$, in other words you 
can move a mine from it's current position denoted by ( $x_{i},y_{i}$ ) to either of the $5$ positions - ( $x_{i}-1,y_{i}$ ), 
( $x_{i}+1,y_{i}$ ) , ( $x_{i},y_{i}-1$ ), ( $x_{i},y_{i}+1$ ), ( $x_{i},y_{i}$ ), such that the new position of the mine 
remains inside the field. A cell can contain multiple mines after relocation.
So, you need to relocate the mines in such a way that maximum number of cells 
get free in the battlefield, incurring minimum damage.
NOTE: 
The operation of relocating a mine from it's current position to either of the $5$ positions such 
 that the new position of the mine remains inside the field can only be performed once for every 
 mine.
Input:

First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
Each testcase contains of a single line of input, two integers $n, m$. 
Then next $n$ lines contain $m$ integers, either 0 or 1. 

Output:
For each testcase, output in a single line, maximum number of cells 
get free in the battlefield.
Constraints

$1 \leq T \leq 20$
$1 \leq n, m \leq 40$
$ n*m \leq 40$
