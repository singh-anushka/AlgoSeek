Chef's friend Nutella visited Chefland for the first time. Now being a close friend of Chef, it's Chef's responsibility to take him around the city for a tour. At the end of his tour, Nuttela visited the 
library in Chefland. Since Nuttela was interested in knowing the history of Chefland, he went to the history section and selected the book named "Roads of Chefland".  
This book contains the details of every road in Chefland, i.e. the cities which are connected by a road in Chefland. Chef went through the roads in the order in which they were built, i.e. if a road A
was built before another road B, then A will appear before B in the sequence.  
A major road is a road which if removed makes some of the cities of Chefland disconnected. Now after going through each road in the book, Chef wanted to know the number of major roads that were present at that point in Chefland.

Input

The first line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N, denoting the number of cities and M, denoting the number of roads in Chefland.
M lines follow. Each of the M lines contains two space-separated integers a and b denoting a road was added between the cities a and b.

Output
After adding every road in the Chefland, print in a new line a single integer denoting the number of major roads in the Chefland.
