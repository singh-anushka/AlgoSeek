After this, there are m lines describing the road. Each line has two integers a and b: there is a road from office a to office b.
Output
Print one integer: the required number of ways. Since the result may be large, print it modulo 10^9+7.
Constraints
•    1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
•    1 ≤ m ≤ 2⋅10^5
•    1 ≤ a,b ≤ n
•    There is no directed cycle.
