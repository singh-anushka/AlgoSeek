Problem is very simple, you're given an array a, consisting of integers . There are m integers  
For each integer  Find number of distinct elements among   
Input
First line contains two integers n and m. Second line contains n integers, the array elements  
Next m lines contains integer  

Output
Print m lines, on the i-th lines print answer to the number  
Constraints

1 ≤ n,m ≤ 105
1 ≤ ai ≤ 105

1 ≤  ≤ n
