41
Explanation:
In example 1 we have total 5 guests out of which 3 are vip with seats 3,6,9 so we have two normal guests to be seated. We book one guest for seat 1 and the other for seat 11.
              1        3                6                9          11
Last guest is at 11 so thatâ€™s our output.
We cant book our guest at seat 4 because of a  guest at seat 3 and neither at 5 because of a guest at seat 6.
