You are given one positive integer N. Calculate
∫∞0e2πx−1e2πx+1(1x−xN2+x2)dx.
It is possible to prove that its value can be written as a fraction ab, where a and b are positive integers and b is coprime with 998,244,353. You need to find a⋅b−1 modulo 998,244,353, where b−1 denotes the multiplicative inverse of b modulo 998,244,353.
Input
The first and only line of the input contains a single integer N.
Output
Print a single line containing one integer a⋅b−1 modulo 998,244,353.
