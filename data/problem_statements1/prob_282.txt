Consider an array AA with NN positive integers. 
Let BB be defined as an array of NN integers such that for each 1≤i≤N1≤i≤N:

Bi=Ai−1Bi=Ai−1, if AiAi is even.
Bi=Ai+1Bi=Ai+1, if AiAi is odd. 

You are given an array CC of size 2⋅N2⋅N which is formed by taking all the elements of the arrays AA and BB and rearranging them.
You need to find the number of distinct arrays AA whose sum of elements is KK, from which CC can be obtained.
Note: Two arrays XX and YY are considered to be distinct if there exists no rearrangement of XX which is the same as YY.
Since the final answer can be very large, print the answer modulo 109+7109+7.
Input Format

The first line contains a single integer TT - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and KK - the parameters mentioned in the statement.
The second line of each test case contains 2⋅N2⋅N space-separated integers C1,C2,…,C2NC1,C2,…,C2N denoting the array CC.

Output Format
For each test case, output the number of distinct arrays AA such that the sum of its elements is KK. Print the answer modulo (109+7109+7).

Explanation
Test case 1: If A=[1,3]A=[1,3], then B=[2,4]B=[2,4]. C=[1,2,3,4]C=[1,2,3,4] can be obtained by rearranging the elements of AA and BB. It can be proven that A=[1,3]A=[1,3] is the only such distinct array whose elements sum to 44. Thus the answer is 11.
Note that arrays [1,3][1,3] and [3,1][3,1] are not distinct.
Test case 2: 

If A=[2,3]A=[2,3], then B=[1,4]B=[1,4]. C=[1,2,3,4]C=[1,2,3,4] can be obtained by rearranging the elements of AA and BB.
If A=[1,4]A=[1,4], then B=[2,3]B=[2,3]. C=[1,2,3,4]C=[1,2,3,4] can be obtained by rearranging the elements of AA and BB.

It can be proven that [2,3][2,3] and [1,4][1,4] are the only such distinct arrays whose elements sum to 55. Thus the answer is 22.
