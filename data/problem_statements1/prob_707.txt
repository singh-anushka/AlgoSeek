The Festive season is coming soon and Lisa is worried that her treehouse is not
ready for the guests. The house has n rooms and n-1 bidirectional paths. From
any room in the treehouse, there is a path to every other room. For each path
Lisa knows whether the path is clean or not.
She has n children in her house numbered from 1 to n. If the i-th child is selected
he promises to clean all the paths from i-th room to room 1, which is the rooted
room of Lisa’s treehouse. In return, Lisa promises to reward these children with
gifts.
Since Lisa has a limited amount of money she wants to select the minimum
number of children in such a way that after they are selected all the paths in the
treehouse is clean.
Input:

The first line consists of n the number of rooms in Lisa’s treehouse 
The next n-1 lines contains three natural numbers u,v and w where u and v are the connected rooms and w represents the condition of the edge {u,v}. 
If w is 1 then the edge {u,v} is clean otherwise if w contains 2 then {u,v} is untidy .

Output:
Print a single integer the minimum number of children Lisa needs to clean the treehouse
Constraints
