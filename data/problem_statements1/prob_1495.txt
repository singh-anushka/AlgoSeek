A lot of guests have suddenly shown up at your house and you only have xx litres of cold water (at y°) at the moment. Due to fear of Covid, each guest brings their own bottle, each of which already has Mi litres of water at Ci°. Each of these bottles has infinite capacity.
If you add cool water to the ith bottle, the temperature changes according to the formula Tfinal=(Mi∗Ci+K∗y)(Mi+K) where K is the amount of cool water you added. 
You wish to maximise the number of containers that have a temperature ≤Q.
Note: It is guaranteed that Q>y.
Input:

The first line contains T, the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains four space separated integers - x, y, Q and n - the amount of cold water you have, the temperature of the 'cold water', the target temperature and the number of bottles.
The next n lines of each test case contain two space separated integers - Mi and Ci - the amount of water and its temperature, in the ith bottle.

Output:
Print the maximum number of bottles whose temperature can be ≤Q.
