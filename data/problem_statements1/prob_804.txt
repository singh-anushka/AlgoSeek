Due to COVID-19, 2020 has been a tough year for Indian Students is especially problematic as students need to spend long period in crowded classes where social distancing is difficult to maintain.
To minimize the spread of COVID-19, each column is separated by 12 fts. .The Institution are hoping that by not making any one "hub", the spread of the virus will be significantly limited. The Institute wants to conduct exam and students want to cheat in class. Classes normally have N bench in a column , running in various directions. Amidst the pandemic, each bench has carefully arranged these N benches in a sequence with each assigned a number from 1 to N. Cheating can only be done between pairs of benches that are adjacent in this sequence, they can cheat in both directions. That is, cheating can be done from bench i to bench j if and only if ∣i−j∣=1.

To make things more complicated, some students have their own restrictions on wanting a chit slip and passing a chit slip. These restrictions are indicated by the characters WC1..N (wanting chits) and PC1..N ,(passing chit) each of which is either "N" or "Y" :
•    If WCi = "N", then incoming slips to bench i from any other bench are disallowed. Otherwise, if WCi = "Y", they may be allowed.
•    If PCi = "N", then passing chits from state i to any other bench are disallowed. Otherwise, if Pi = "Y", they may be allowed.
As a consulting data scientist of the class, your job is to determine which benching between the various benches are possible. Let Pi,j = "Y" if it's possible to travel from state i to state j via a sequence of  0 or more trains (which may pass through other states along the way), and Pi,j = "N" otherwise. Note that Pi,i is always "Y". Output this N∗N matrix of characters.

Input:

Input begins with an integer T, the number of column in class. For each case, there are three lines. The first line contains the integer N, number of benches in a column . The second line contains the length-N string WC1..N. The third line contains the length-N string PC1..N.

Output:

For the ith test case, output a line containing "Case #i:" followed by N more lines, the ith of which contains the length-N string Pi,1..N.
