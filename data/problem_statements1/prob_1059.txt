A famous student of AESC MSU, as you know, comes from Kostomuksha. Kostomuksha has a popular game called Doka.
The essence of Doka is as follows:
You are given an array AA and an integer XX. You want to calculate how many subarrays of this array have a geometric mean of XX. 
Formally, calculate the number of pairs of integers (L,R) such that 1≤L≤R≤N and
R−L+1√AL⋅AL+1⋅…⋅AR=X
Input Format

The first line of input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
Each test case consists of two lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N,X — the size of the array A and the required geometric mean.
The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.

Output Format
For each test case, on a new line print the number of subarrays that satisfy the condition.
Constraints

1≤T≤103
1≤N≤2⋅105
1≤X,Ai≤109
Sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105.

Explanation
Test case 1: Every subarray has a geometric mean of 3, and there are 6 subarrays in total so the answer is 6.
Test case 2: The only subarray with a geometric mean of 4 is the singleton array [4], obtained with L=R=4.
Test case 3: The 6 pairs of (L,R) which have a geometric mean of 54 are:

(1,2), giving the subarray [36,81]
(1,3), giving the subarray [36,81,54]
(1,4), giving the subarray [36,81,54,54]
(3,3), giving the subarray [54]
(3,4), giving the subarray [54,54]
(4,4), giving the subarray [54]
