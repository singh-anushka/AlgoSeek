With this jump, you move further in time and land inside the NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration]. The ways of time are completely bizarre. You hear the same laugh which pushed you in this machine and you turn to find the mad scientist, Prof Paradox. He laughs telling you that you have entered doomsday and that the whole Homosapien species ends that day. Though shocked you are determined to stop this, whatever it might be.
Prof Paradox is a part of the Asteroid Impact Avoidance Committee [AIAC] in NASA and he informs you that NN asteroids, with varying sizes, are approaching Earth and if left unattended, it will end life on Earth as we know it. Fortunately you have KK nuclear plasma blasters that can destroy an asteroid. The cost of each blast is determined by the size of the asteroid. However, after each blast, the cost required increases. 
If x is the number of blasts already fired by a blaster Bi, then the cost of the next blast in the blaster Bi is (x+1)∗S where S is the size of the asteroid. You are free to use any number of the available K blasters. 
Can you avoid this collision course by finding the minimum cost required to save our planet?
Since the results can be large, output result modulo 1000000007 (109+7).
Input:

First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
First line of each testcase contains of a single line of input, two integers N,K.
Second line of each testcase contains N spaced integers denoting the size of the asteroid. 

Output:
For each testcase, output in a single line the minimum cost required to destroy all the asteroids modulo 1000000007.

EXPLANATION 1:
We have 3 plasma blasters,                                                                     
1st and 2nd asteroid can be shot by blaster 1:
Cost=(4∗1)+(2∗2)=8
3rd and 4th asteroid can be shot by blaster 2:
Cost=(5∗1)+(3∗2)=11
5th asteroid can be shot by blaster 3:
Cost=(9∗1)=9
Therefore, Total Cost = 8+11+9 = 28.
It can be verified that any other possible combination results in a larger cost.
