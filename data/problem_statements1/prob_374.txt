You are given a tree with NN nodes numbered 11 through N. Each node is initially colored white. We perform the following process on this tree:

choose an unordered pair of vertices (a,b) uniformly at random (i.e. each pair has an equal probability of being picked)
if there is a black node on the shortest path between a and b (including a and b), the process stops
otherwise:
all nodes on this path are colored black
then, go back to the first step

What is the expected number of times the process returns to the first step until it ends? It can be proved that this number may be represented as a fraction P/Q, where P and Q are coprime integers and Q≠0 modulo 998244353. Compute P⋅Q−1 modulo 998244353, where Q−1 denotes the inverse of Q modulo 998244353.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer N.
Each of the next N−1 lines contains two space-separated integers u and v denoting an edge between vertices u and v.

Output
Print a single line containing one integer, P⋅Q−1 modulo 998244353.
Constraints

2≤N≤2,000
1≤u,v≤N
the graph described on the input is a tree

Example Input

1 2

Example Output
887328315

Explanation
There are 3 possible paths: (1,1), (1,2) and (2,2).

If we paint (1,2) first, then whichever path we choose next, we will end with 1 return. This happens with probability 1/3.
If we paint (1,1) or (2,2) first, there is only one way we can end with 2 returns: by choosing the path consisting of the other unpainted vertex next. Therefore, with probability 2/3⋅1/3, we end with 2 returns and with probability 2/3⋅2/3, we end with 1 return.

In total, the expected value is 1⋅13+1⋅49+2⋅29=119. Since 9−1=443664157 modulo 998244353, the answer is (11⋅443664157)%998244353.
