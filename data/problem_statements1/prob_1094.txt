You are given two natural number AA and B . Let C be their product i.e. C=A×B.
Lets  say C has n factors (not necessarily prime factors) a1,a2,a3,a4,a5...an .
Also ,lets define a function  F(x) such that  
F(x)=p1×q1+p2×q2+p3×q3+.....pm×qm
where prime factorisation of x is x=p1q1×p2q2× p3q3×…pmqm
You need to find ANS,where ANS=F(a1)+F(a2)+F(a3)+F(a4)+.....+F(an)
Note : F(1)=0
Input:

First-line will contain T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case has a single line of input containing two space separated integer A and B.

Output:
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer which is equal to ANS
