Tumut, the best programmer in his village Applidz, invented a problem and decided to share it with you:
You are given two integer sequences S1,S2,…,SN and T1,T2,…,TM and an integer x. You are allowed to perform the following operation any number of times:

choose an element of S and an element of T (let's denote them by Si and Tj respectively)
decrease both Si and Tj by x, i.e. replace Si by Si−x and Tj by Tj−x

Let's denote the minimum and maximum value in the sequence S after performing the chosen operations (possibly none) by minS and maxS respectively. Similarly, let's denote the minimum and maximum value in T after performing the chosen operations by minT and maxT respectively. The goal is minimizing the expression (maxS+maxT)−(minS+minT). Compute the minimum value of this expression. 
Input

The first line of the input contains three space-separated integers N, M and x.
The second line contains N space-separated integers S1,S2…SN.
The third line contains M space-separated integers T1,T2…TM.

Output
Print a single line containing one integer — the minimum possible value of the expression (maxS+maxT)−(minS+minT).

Explanation
We can perform these two operations:

decrease S2 and T1 by x
decrease S2 and T2 by x

Afterwards, the sequence S will be [1,2] and the sequence T will be [−1,0]. The resulting value of the given expression is (2+0)−(1+(−1))=2. It is impossible to obtain a smaller value no matter how many operations are performed.
