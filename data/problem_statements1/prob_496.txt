For a table in a restaurant which divided by n x m cells, the waiter has randomly placed Ice-cream and gulab jamun on each cell of the table. Find out the largest rectangle which can be formed by Ice-creams only such that there is no gulab jamun within the rectangle. 
Note: Ice-cream is represented by char values as '1' and gulab jamun by '0'. The input is given in the form of n x m Matrix containing zeros and ones.
Input Format

First line has two space separated integers n,mn,m which form the nxm matrix.
Next nn lines represents the space separated m elements as char values ′1′ or ′0′.

Output Format
output is the resulting area in integer.
Constraints
1 <= n, m  <= 200
matrix[i][j] is 0 or 1.
