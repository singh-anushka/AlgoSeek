Let S(N)S(N) denote the sum of digits of a positive integer NN. You are given three positive integers X, Y and Z. Consider all triples of positive integers (A,B,C) such that:

S(A+B)=X
S(B+C)=Y
S(C+A)=Z

Your task is to find the triple which maximises S(A+B+C) and the triple which minimises S(A+B+C). Specifically, you are given an additional integer P with the following meaning:

If P=0, find the maximum value of S(A+B+C) and one triple (A,B,C) corresponding to this maximum value.
If P=1, find the minimum value of S(A+B+C) and one triple (A,B,C) corresponding to this minimum value.

If there are multiple solutions, you may find any one of them.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains four space-separated integers X, Y, Z and P.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing four space-separated integers — the minimum or maximum value of S and the corresponding values of A, B and C.
A, B and C should be printed without leading zeros. The number of digits in each of A, B and C should not exceed 5⋅105. The total number of digits in the integers A, B and C in all test cases should not exceed 107.
