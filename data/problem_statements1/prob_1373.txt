You have NN piles of spoons numbered 1,2,…,N1,2,…,N. Initially the ii-th pile contains Ai spoons. 
In a single operation, you can do the following:

Choose three integers p,q,x satisfying 1≤p,q≤n, p≠q, 1≤x≤Ap≤Aq. Shift x spoons from pile p to pile q, that is, add x to Aq and subtract x from Ap.

You want to shift all spoons to pile 1. It can be proved that, if it is possible to shift all spoons to pile 1, then there exists a sequence of ≤2n operations which achieves this objective. Either find such a sequence of ≤2n operations , or claim that no such sequence exists.
Input:

First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
The first line of each testcase contains a single integer, N.
The second line contains N space separated integers, A1,A2,…,AN.

Output:
For each testcase:

If it is impossible to shift all spoons to the first pile, print −1.
Else, first print the number of operations (say k, which must be ≤2n) on a new line.Then, print k lines. The i-th line should contain the p,q and x you chose in the i-th operation. If the triple (p,q,x) doesn't satisfy 1≤p,q≤n,p≠q,1≤x≤Ap≤Aq, you get a wrong answer verdict.

Constraints

1≤T≤105
2≤N≤105
The sum of N over all testcases doesn't exceed 105.
1≤Ai≤1018
The total number of spoons doesn't exceed 1018

Explanation
In the first example, A=[4,3,5].

First, choose p=2,q=1,x=3. After this operation, A=[7,0,5].
Now, choose p=3,q=1,x=5. Now, A=[12,0,0] as required.

In the second example, we will never be able to shift spoons from the second pile to the first. So, we print −1.
