You have a dog named Cheems. He also has a girlfriend Cheema. 
For Valentines Day, Cheems want to gift something to Cheema. He decided to give her a series of blocks painted with Cheema’s photos. But he can only paint in steps.
In ith step, he will paint one block and move i blocks forward. ( i starts from 1 ).
For eg, if he starts with first block, he will paint the following blocks :- 1, 2, 4, 7, 11, 16, …… (Lets denote this as one process). But he will miss many blocks in between. 
So he has to start again by choosing a different initial block (can be any)  and follow the same process till all N blocks are painted. (During each process he will choose an initial block and follow the above given steps). 
He is allowed to paint one block one or more times. 
Cheems is weak in maths and lazy so he wants to paint all the boxes in minimum possible process. Help him!

Input:

First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
Each testcase contains of a single line of input, integer N - total number of blocks. 


Output:
For each testcase, output in a single line minimum number of processes required to paint all the boxes.

Constraints

1≤T≤105
0≤N≤109


Sample Input:
4
1
3
4
6


Sample Output:
1
2
2
3


EXPLANATION:
Test case 1: He has only one block and he will start from that one block. So clearly one process.
Test case 2:
1st process: 1 => 2 => 4
2nd process: 2 => 3 => 5  
Test case 4:
1st process: 1 => 2 => 4
2nd process: 3 => 4 => 6
3rd process: 5
