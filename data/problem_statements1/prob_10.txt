A thermal decomposition reaction is breakdown of a compound into one or more compounds when heated.
For example, P→a⋅Q+b⋅RP→a⋅Q+b⋅R is a decomposition reaction. Here, 11 unit of PP is converted into aa unit of QQ and bb unit of RR after completion of the reaction.
You are given NN compounds numbered from 11 to NN. The initial amount of the ithith compound is QiQi. 
You are also given MM equations. Every equation is of the form: 
C0→W1⋅C1+W2⋅C2+…+WX⋅CXC0→W1⋅C1+W2⋅C2+…+WX⋅CX.
Here:

C0C0 represents the compound which will decompose into XX compounds on heating.
CiCi (1≤i≤X)(1≤i≤X) represents the compounds into which C0C0 is decomposed.
WiWi (1≤i≤X)(1≤i≤X) represents the number of units of CiCi produced due to the decomposition of C0C0.
Ci>Ci−1Ci>Ci−1 for all (1≤i≤X)(1≤i≤X).

Note that a compound can decompose in at most one way only.
Find the final amount of each compound after prolonged heating. Since the number can be huge, print the answer modulo 109+7109+7.

Explanation
Test Cse 11: We have 44 compounds initially. For better explanation, we refer the compounds 1,2,3,1,2,3, and 44 as A1,A2,A3,A1,A2,A3, and A4A4 respectively. Initially, the amount of A1,A2,A3,A1,A2,A3, and A4A4 present is 5,10,12,5,10,12, and 22 respectively.
The two equations are:

A1→3⋅A2+4⋅A3A1→3⋅A2+4⋅A3
A3→2⋅A4A3→2⋅A4

We know that 11 unit of A1A1 produces 33 units of A2A2 and 44 units of A3A3. Thus, the initial 55 units of A1A1 decompose to 5⋅3=155⋅3=15 units of A2A2 and 5⋅4=205⋅4=20 units of A3A3. Note that now there are 00 units of A1A1 left.
Considering only this reaction, the updated amounts of chemicals would be [0,10+15,12+20,2]=[0,25,32,2][0,10+15,12+20,2]=[0,25,32,2].
We also know that 11 unit of A3A3 decomposes to 22 units of A4A4. The total amount of A3A3 available for decomposition would be 3232 units (12(12 units were available initially and 2020 units were formed due to decomposition)). Thus these 3232 units would produce 32⋅2=6432⋅2=64 units of A4A4.
Thus, after prolonged heating, the amounts of compounds are [0,25,0,64+2]=[0,25,0,66][0,25,0,64+2]=[0,25,0,66].
