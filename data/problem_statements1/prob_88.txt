You are given two integers NN and MM. Find the number of sequences A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN, where each element is an integer between 1 and M (inclusive) and no three consecutive elements are equal. Since this number could be very large, compute it modulo 109+7.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and M.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the number of valid sequences modulo 109+7.
