Chef has NN items in his Shop (numbered 11 through N); And for Each valid i (1<=i<=N).       the weight of the i−th item is Wi. Since Chef is very sensitive in nature.
Chef wants to arrange all even weights items one side and odd weights items on another side. Chef can arrange two adjacent items with help of swapping at one operation.
Chef wants a minimum number of operations required to arrange All Even weights item on one side and All Odd weights item to the another side.
Chef can’t solve this problem so he asks you to solve it. Help Chef to solve this problem.
Input:

First-line will contain T, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. 
The first line of each test case contains a single line integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers
W1,W2,…,WN

Output:
Print the minimum number of operations required Chef can make it. If Chef can't take any operations, print 0.
Constraints

1≤T≤100
2≤N≤105
3≤Wi≤105
The sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅105

Sample Input:
3
6
1 2 3 4 5 6
5
5 7 3 10 20
3
1 8 7

Sample Output:
3
0
1

EXPLANATION:
Example case 1:  You can arrange all even numbers right side. 
Numbers of swaps 6 arrange at position 6th is 0 operations, 4 arrange at position 5th is 1 operations, 2 arrange at position 4th is 2 operations.
Given array [1,2,3,4,5,6] to [1,3,5,2,4,6]
Total : 0 + 1 + 2 = 3 operations
Example case 2: Initially All odd number one side and all even number another side, so minimum number of operations : 0.
