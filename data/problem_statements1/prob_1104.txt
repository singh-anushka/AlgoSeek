Chef has an array a1,…,an of n elements. Initially, all elements of the array are equal to 1. There are two types of operations. 

1 i:  Take the index i (1≤i≤n), and multiply it by 2 (ai:=2⋅ai).
2 i j:  Take two indexes i and j (1≤i,j≤n,i≠j), and subtract aj from ai, (ai:=ai−aj).

All elements must be positive after each operation, and at most 109. 
In addition, you are given an array b. Chef wants to make b from a. Help Chef to reach the array b in no more than 43 000 operations, or determine it is impossible.
Input:

The first line contains a single integer n - size of the array.
The second line contains n integers b1,…bn - the array b. 

Output:
If it is impossible to reach b, print −1.
Otherwise, output k - the number of operations (0≤k≤43 000). On the next k lines, print the operations as described in the statement.
If there are multiple solutions, you may output any.

Explanation
Test Case 1: Initially, the array a is [1,1,1].
By the first operation, a3:=2⋅a3, so the array becomes [1,1,2].
By the second operation, a3:=2⋅a3, so the array becomes [1,1,4].
By the third operation, a3:=a3−a1, so the array becomes [1,1,3].
By the fourth operation, a2:=2⋅a2, so the array becomes [1,2,3]. Now the array is equal to b, as desired.
