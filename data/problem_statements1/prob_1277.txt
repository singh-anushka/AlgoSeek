Nishant does pretty weird stuff. Today, he wants to create a weird sequence.
According to Nishant, a sequence AA of length NN is called weird if:

N≥3
2⋅Ai>Ai−1+Ai+1 ∀i∈{2,3,4....,N−1}

Nishant wants to construct a long weird sequence to impress his weird friends, but there's a problem:  he only knows how to count up to K, so the sequence can only contain integers in the range [1,K]. 
Help Nishant determine the length of the longest weird sequence he can construct using only integers from 1 to K.
Input Format

The first line contains a single integer T denoting the number of testcases. The description of T testcases follows.
The first and only line of each testcase contains a single integer K.

Output Format
For each testcase, print one line containing a single integer - the maximum length of a weird sequence which can be obtained using only integers in [1,K].
Constraints

1≤T≤105
2≤K≤109

Explanation
Test Case 1: One possible weird sequence is {1,3,3,2}. It can be shown that there is no weird sequence with length >4.
Test Case 2: One possible weird sequence is {2,4,5,5,4,1}. It can be shown that there is no weird sequence with length >6.
