There are N towns in a line, numbered from 0 to N - 1. Starting from town 0, we want to reach town N - 1. From town i, we can jump to any town j > i with an energy cost of (j-i)*A[i] + (j2 - i2)*A[i]2, where A[i] for all i are given in input.

Find the minimum total energy cost to reach town N - 1 from town 0. 


Input


The first line contains a single integer, N.
The next line contains N space separated integers, ith integer denoting the value of A[i] , 0 ≤ i ≤ N - 1.

Output

Output the minimum cost to reach town N.

Constraints

1 ≤ N ≤ 105
-103 ≤ A[i] ≤ 103
