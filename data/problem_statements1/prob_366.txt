Amal decided to make some money doing business on the Internet for exactly n days. She knows that on the i-th day (1 ≤ i ≤ n) she makes ai money. Amal loves progress, that's why she wants to know the length of the maximum non-decreasing subsegment in sequence ai. Let us remind you that the subsegment of the sequence is its continuous fragment. A subsegment of numbers is called non-decreasing if all numbers in it follow in the non-decreasing order.
Help Amal cope with this task!
Input

The first line contains a single positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), number of days.
The second line contains n integers a1,  a2,  ...,  an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 109).

Output
Print a single integer — the length of the maximum non-decreasing subsegment of sequence a.

Note

In the first test the maximum non-decreasing subsegment is the numbers from the third to the fifth one.
In the second test the maximum non-decreasing subsegment is the numbers from the first to the third one.
