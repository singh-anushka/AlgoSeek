An array is said to be good if all the elements of the array have the same parity. For example, the arrays [2,8][2,8] and [9,1,3] are good while the array [4,5,6] is not good.
Given an array A of size N. You can perform the following operation on the array:

Choose indices i and j (1≤i,j≤|A|,i≠j).
Append Ai+Aj to the array A.
Remove the ith and jth elements from the array A.

Find the minimum number of operations required to make the array good.
It is guaranteed that the array can be converted to a good array using a finite number of operations.
Input Format

The first line contains a single integer T - number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N - the size of the array.
The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, …, AN.

Output Format
For each test case, print a single integer denoting the minimum number of operations required to make the array good.
Constraints

1≤T≤104
1≤N≤2⋅105
0≤ Ai≤ 105
Sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105.

Explanation
Test case 1: In one operation, choose i=1 and j=3. Thus, we remove the elements 1 and 3 from the array and append 1+3=4 to the array.
The updated array is [2,4,4]. All elements of the updated array are even. Thus, the array is good.
Test case 2: All elements of the array are 1, which is odd. Thus, the array is already good.
