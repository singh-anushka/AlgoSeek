Our very own SS sir is teaching data structures to his students. He told the students that a full binary tree is a tree in which every node other than the leaves have two children. If one more edge is added to tree, it will definitely form a cycle.
He has given an assignment to the students :-
He has an infinite full binary tree.
The root is labelled as 1.
For a node labelled v its left child will be labelled 2*v and its right child will be labelled 2*v+1.
Now he joins two nodes A and B. He wants to know the length of the cycle formed.
The students are in fix. Help them to find the length of the cycle formed.
NOTE: The line joining A and B will not cross any other node.
Input
First line contains Q, the number of queries. Each query consists of two space separated integers A and B in one line.
Output
For each query, print the required answer in one line.
Constraints

1 ≤ N ≤ 105
1 ≤ i , j ≤ 1018

Example
Input:
3
2 3
2 7
5 15

Output:
3
4
6

Explanation
For 1st query, the length of the cycle formed is 3 (2 -> 1 -> 3 ->2)
