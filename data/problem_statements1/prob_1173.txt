Programming Contests have now become quite popular these days. People from all over the world participate in these contest individually and in teams.

 
A team of n friends decided to take part in the annual "CodeHunt Coding Contest". For participating in CodeHunt, all the members of the team must have exactly same rating. 


Currently all n friends have a current rating of R1,R2,R3....Rn individually.
Since, for participating in the contest all the members of the team must have exact same rating. They decided to change there rating (increase/decrease there respective rating) and make it equal to any of the friends, say TEAM LEADER, so that all friends have the same score.


Find the total changes in the rating made by n friends. Choose TEAM LEADER in such a way, that the total changes in rating, made by n friend, is minimum.

Input

The first input line contains an integer n,
n : the number of friends.
The second line takes the n integers,
R1, R2, R3....Rn.

Output

Print one integer: the minimum total changes in rating.

Constraints

1 <= n <= 2â‹…10^5
1 <= Ri <= 10^9

Sample Input:

5
2 3 1 5 2

Sample Output:
5
Explanation:

There are n=5 friends with rating [2,3,1,5,2]. In this particular test case, the friend with score 2 is selected as the team leader. So, total changes made to make all member 2 is 5.
