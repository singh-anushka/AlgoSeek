The random gravitational anomalies often used to follow mathematical patterns. Is this one of them?
Consider a number N. The Euler Totient function, given by φ(N) is the number of natural numbers that are less than or equal to N and are relatively prime to N. Let us define the following functions:

f(x) = number of factors of the number x
pre(y) = number of x, 1≤x≤y such that φ(x)>f(x)
post(y) = number of x, 1≤x≤y such that φ(x)<f(x)

You are given N. Calculate pre(N) and post(N).
Input Format

First line will contain T, number of testcases.
Each testcase contains of a single line of input, an integer N. 

Constraints

1≤T≤1000
1≤N≤1018

Output Format
For each testcase, output in a single line two integers which are pre(N) and post(N).
Sample Input:
1
3

Sample Output
0 1

Explanation
2 has φ(2)=1 and 2 factors.
