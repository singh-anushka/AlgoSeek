There are three friends Mota , Chotua and Expert. Recently they all get placed  at reputed MNC.  Mota, a foodie person have already  decided to spend all his money on Samosa, while his friends Chotua and Expert have different plans and there cumulative salary is N coins. 
Chotua and Expert are competitive in nature and due to  this  their friend Mota decided to give equal numbers of coins to both of them  people.
He has two options

Choose some number k. Considering all coins identical, give k coins to Chotua. Next, treat remaining n−k coins as distinct and give k coins to Expert. Lets say there are p1 ways to do so for all possible k.
Choose some number k. Considering all coins distinct, give k coins to Chotua. Next ,treat remaining n−k coins as identical and give k coins to Expert. Lets say there are p2 ways to do so for all possible k.

Calculate the ratio of p1 and  p2 . As this number can be rather large,he asks you to count the remainder after dividing it with 109+7.
Note it is guaranteed that n is odd.
Input Format:

1st line contains T which denotes number of testcase.
Following T lines contains single integer N denoting cumulative salary .

Output Format:

A single integer denoting the ratio of p1 and  p2 modulo 109 + 7.

Constraints:

1≤T≤105
1≤N≤1018−1 where N is odd

Sample Input
2
1
3
Sample Output
1
750000006
Explanation

In the first case there is only one way for the first option , 0 coins to both i.e p1=1 .Similarly one way for the second option i.e  p2=1. p1/p2=1; 
In Second case ,here are 4 ways for option 2 {0 coins to both},{1st coin to B},{2nd coin to B},{3rd coin to B}.So p2=4there are 3 ways

1-> 0 coins to both
2,3-> 1 coins to B then 2 ways to pick 1 coin from the remaining 2 coins.
For the first option ie p1=3. 
Hence answer is (3/4) % 1000000007 =750000006
