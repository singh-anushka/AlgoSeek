Chef was tired of dancing at the party and decided to partition the array such that each element is in a partition and the partition are subsegments of the array. He also defined a partitioning to be good if in every partition there is at max K unique numbers. Now chef is wondering how many good partitions of the given array exist. Help him calculate this value  mod 1e9 + 7. 

 
Input
The first line of each test case contains a two integers N and K. The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the elements of the array.
 
Output
Output one integer, the number of good partition mod 1e9 + 7.
 
Subtasks
Subtask 1(20 points): N ≤ 103,MAX = 104
Subtask 2(20 points): N ≤ 103,MAX = 109
Subtask 3(60 points): N ≤ 105,MAX = 109
Example
Input:
4 2
1 2 3 2

Output:
6

 
Explanation
The good partitions are as follows: 1|2|3|2, 1|2|3 2, 1|2 3 2, 1|2 3|2, 1 2|3 2, 1 2|3|2
