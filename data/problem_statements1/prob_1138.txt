You are given a set S of K numbers which is a set of first K powers of 2 (ie. 1,2,4,8,…)
Given N you have to construct an Array A[0, …, N−1]  of length N such that A[i] must belong to S for all i, 0 <= i < N.
Find the maximum value of A[0] XOR A[1] XOR … XOR A[N−1] that you can achieve. Here XOR is bitwise xor operator. Also, tell the number of arrays A that gives this maximum XOR.
Print both the numbers mod 109+7.
Input:

First line of Input contains the no of test cases T.
Each of the next T lines contains two integers: N and K.

Output:

For every test case, print two space-separated integers: maximum possible XOR and the no of possible ways respectively, modulo 109+7.

Constraints

1≤T≤100000
1≤N≤109+7
1≤K≤100000
K≤N
Sum of  K over all testcases ≤1000000

Sample Input:
1
3 3
Sample Output:
7 6
Explanation:
Here S=1,2,4
Then max xor is 1 xor 2 xor 4=7
Number of A= all permutation of [1,2,4]=6
Therefore the output would be 7 6.
