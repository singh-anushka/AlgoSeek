Mr. Shaurya is a great competitive programmer of NIT Kurukshetra. He tries his best to teach Algorithms and Data Structures to his juniors in the best possible way. He always gives creative questions to his students so that students never get bored. As this year is bad because of COVID-19, he tries to give a problem on Coronavirus to his students. He came up with an interesting question.
There is a matrix A of size N∗M, consisting of N rows and M columns.  The rows are numbered from 1,2,..,N and columns are numbered from 1,2,...,M. Each cell is represented by Ai,j. The cell can be empty, blocked, or contain the deadly coronavirus. The virus can move only in the same row or in the same column until it gets blocked. The virus can only move in empty positions and contaminate the cell. You have to count the number of cells that get contaminated. Each cell can contain at most 1 virus, and cells can be contaminated by more than 1 virus. The cells containing the virus initially are also contaminated.
Input:

The first line consists of a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.
The Second line contains two space-separated integers N and M, denoting the number of rows and columns of the matrix.
The next N lines contain M space-separated integers. The integer 0 denotes empty cell, 1 denotes cell containing a virus, and -1 denotes that the cell is blocked.

Output:
For each test case, print a single integer on a new line denoting the number of cells contaminated by the Corona Virus.
Constraints

1≤T≤100
1≤N,M≤103
Sum of N∗M for all test cases ≤106

Sample Input:

3 3
1 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 0
4 5
1 0 0 -1 0
-1 -1 0 0 1
0 1 -1 0 -1
0 0 0 0 0

Sample Output:
5
10

EXPLANATION:
First test Case : A1,1 can move only in row 1 and column 1 i.e, at position A1,2, A1,3, A2,1, A3,1. Thus, total contaminated cells are 5 including A1,1.
Second Test Case : A1,1 can move at cells only A1,1, A1,2, A1,3. It cannot move to cell A1,4 and to its right because cell A1,4 is blocked. Similarly A1,1 can not move downwards. 
A3,2 can move to A3,1 and A4,2.  A2,5 can move to A2,3, A2,4 and A1,5. Thus total contaminated cells are 10.
