Phoenix is very tired of his examinations and he only has his mathematics paper remaining. Now, Phoenix hates mathematics and this year he had to take mathematics as an elective because all his friends were in it. This year’s course contains linear equations and factorization and he is good in only factorization. So, after practicing mathematics for the whole night, he entered the exam hall.
He opened the paper and found just one question ending in “…sum of the factors of X.” and he became glad. But all his hopes came crashing down as he read the whole question. It went like this - 
“Given a system of linear equations, solve them and find the sum of its solutions. Consider the absolute value of the sum of its solutions as X, and choose the option that correctly shows the sum of the factors of X.”
Now, it’s all up to you to help Phoenix end his test in a pleasant manner so that he can be happy that he cleared his examinations and can enjoy his summer vacations. Can you help him?
Input:

First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
Each testcase contains of a single line of input, having an integer N followed by N lines having the coefficients of the equation and the RHS. 

Output:
For each testcase, output in a single line the sum of all the factors of X.
Constraints

1≤T≤10
2≤N≤20
|coefficient|≤30

Sample Input:
    1
    2
    2 3 5
    3 3 6

Sample Output:
    3

EXPLANATION:
This value of N is 2 so we can infer that that there are two linear equations of two variables.
The equations are
2a+3b=5
3a+3b=6
Now, finding the solutions of the variables, it can be said that a = 1 and b = 1, hence their sum is 2.
The sum of all the factors of 2 i.e, 1 and 2 is 3, hence the output.
Note
There are n linear equations denoting the straight lines in an n-dimensional space and hence it should not be assumed that it is only limited to 3D or 2D space.
