You are provided a number NN. In one step, you can either divide NN by 6(if N is 0) or multiply N by 2 .
Find the minimum number of steps required to get 1 from N or check if it is not possible.
Input:

First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
The only line of the test case contains a number N .

Output:
For each test case, print 

the minimum number of steps required to get 1 from N, it is possible to do          
−1, it is impossible to obtain 1 from N.

Constraints

1≤T≤2⋅104
1≤N≤109
N is integer

Sample Input:
    4
    1
    2
    3
    15116544

Sample Output:
    0
   -1
    2
    12

EXPLANATION:
Consider the fourth test case.
Divide N by 6 four times in a row and get 11664 (Updated N).
Multiply N by 2 and get 23328.
Divide N by 6 three times in a row and get 108 (Updated N).
Multiply by 2 and get 216
Divide N by 6 three times in a row and get 1.
