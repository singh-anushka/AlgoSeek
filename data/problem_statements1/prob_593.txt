RK was playing with Strings. One day he came across the following problem. He wanted to find the number of ways to split  a string S to substrings such that if there are k substrings (p1, p2, p3, ..., pk) in partition, then pi = pk-i+1  for all i (1 ≤ i ≤ k) and k is even.

Since the number of ways can be very large, print it modulo 109 + 7.
Input

The only line of the input consist of a string S.

Output

Print the number of ways modulo 109 + 7.

Constraints

2 ≤ |S| ≤ 106

Example
Input:
abbababababbab
Output:
3

Explanation
The string can be partitioned as ab|b|ab|ab|ab|ab|b|ab or ab|b|abab|abab|b|ab or abbab|ab|ab|abbab. Thus total number of ways = 3.
