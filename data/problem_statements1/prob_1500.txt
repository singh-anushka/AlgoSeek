You have R red, G green and B blue balloons. To decorate a single table for the banquet you need exactly three balloons. Three balloons attached to some table shouldn't have the same color. What maximum number N of tables can be decorated if we know number of balloons of each color?
Your task is to write a program that for given values R, G and B will find the maximum number N of tables, that can be decorated in the required manner.
Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains 3 space separated integers R, G and B — the number of red, green and blue baloons respectively.
Output
For each test case, output a single integer N — the maximum number of tables that can be decorated in the required manner.

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 105
1 ≤ R ≤ 2*109
1 ≤ G ≤ 2*109
1 ≤ B ≤ 2*109

Example
Input:
3
5 4 3
1 1 1
2 3 3
Output:
4
1
2

Explanation
Example case 1. You can decorate the tables with the following balloon sets: "rgg", "gbb", "brr", "rrg", where "r", "g" and "b" represent the red, green and blue balls, respectively.
