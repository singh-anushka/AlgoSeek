Ridbit is given an array a1,a2,…,aNa1,a2,…,aN. He needs to find the number of ways to divide the array into contiguous subarrays such that:

Each element of the sequence aa belongs to exactly one of the subarrays.
There is an integer m such that the MEX of every subarray is equal to m. The MEX of a sequence is the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in this sequence.

Help Ridbit with this task.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers a1,a2,…,aN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the number of ways to divide the sequence, modulo 109+7.
Constraints

1≤T≤10
1≤N≤100,000
0≤ai≤N for each valid i

Explanation
Example case 1: The five valid ways to divide the sequence are:

[1,0,0,1,0,1]
[1,0],[0,1,0,1]
[1,0,0],[1,0,1]
[1,0,0,1],[0,1]
[1,0],[0,1],[0,1]
