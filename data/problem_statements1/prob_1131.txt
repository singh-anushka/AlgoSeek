Ram plays a strange number game. There are NN blocks numbered from  11  to N.
At the beginning of game ram is at  Nth block and he wants to come at  1st block to win the game in minimum number of moves.
In one move, he can perform one of the following operations

If the number is power of two then divide it by  2  and that becomes the new position of Ram
If not then reduce it by the next lower number which is power of  2  which is Ram's new position

Input:

First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
Each testcase contains an integer N (initial position of Ram).

Output:
For Each test case print a single line minimum number of moves.
