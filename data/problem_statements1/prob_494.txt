You are given NN integers to find the length of the longest subarray whose LCM is equal to the product of elements in the subarray.
Input:
In the first line, you are given T number of test cases.
Each test case follows:

An integer N 
The next line contains N integers separated by space

Output:
For each test case print the longest length of a subarray in a new line
If no subarray exist print "-1"
Sample Input:
3
2
7 2
4
2 2 3 4
3
2 2 4
Sample Output:
2
2
-1
Explanation:
Case 1. LCM(2,7)=2*7. Therefore, subarray A1 to A2 satisfies.
Case 2. The subarrays A2 to A3 and A3 to A4 are the maximum size possible.
Case 3. No subarray will satisfy.
