Chef has two buckets containing a and b litres of water. Chef wants to empty both buckets. To do that, he may perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero): in each operation, he can either remove one litre from the first bucket and two litres from the second bucket, or two litres from the first bucket and one litre from the second bucket.
Chef asks you whether it is possible to empty both buckets.

•    0 ≤ a,b ≤ 10^9
