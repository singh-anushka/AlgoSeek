Alice gives Bob two integers A and N. Alice defines a series as follows
Starting with A, next term in series is square of previous term i.e.
T[N]=(T[N−1])2
T[1]=A
Since Nth term could be very large therefore she asks Bob to tell the unit digit of Nth term. Bob is currently busy with his homework can you solve this for him ?
Input:

First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
Each testcase contains of a single line of input, two integers A,N. 

Output:
For each testcase, output in a single line answer unit digit of Nth term.
