There are NN students standing in a row and numbered 11 through NN from left to right. You are given a string SS with length NN, where for each valid ii, the ii-th character of SS is 'x' if the ii-th student is a girl or 'y' if this student is a boy. Students standing next to each other in the row are friends.
The students are asked to form pairs for a dance competition. Each pair must consist of a boy and a girl. Two students can only form a pair if they are friends. Each student can only be part of at most one pair. What is the maximum number of pairs that can be formed?
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single string SS.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the maximum number of pairs.

Explanation
Example case 1: There is only one possible pair: (first student, second student).
Example case 2: One of the ways to form two pairs is: (first student, second student) and (fourth student, fifth student). 
Another way to form two pairs is: (second student, third student) and (fourth student, fifth student).
