It is time of i.fest'16 and deadline is till 2 am for girls. Last night one newly formed couple (Mr.X and Miss.Y)
was going on CR. Seeing this Mr.Z who has a big crush on Miss Y since first year, wants to follow them and see what 
they are doing this late.So assuming CR as a circular track of radius r. Both the couple and Mr.Z starts from canteen.
They start either in same direction or in the opposite direction, indefinitely (for infinite time).

The speed of both of them is given to you with radius of circle.
Speed will be positive in clockwise(HoR-Women) direction, and negative in anticlockwise(HoR-Men) direction. 
Print the number of distinct points, at which they will meet on the circle.

If both couple and Mr. Z are travelling with the same speed print "INF" (without inverted comma).

Input

First line contains T, number of test cases.
Each test case contains three space separated integers, r, v1 and v2. 
Here r is the radius of the circular track and v1 and v2 are the velocity of couple and Mr. Z respectively.

Output

For each test case print an integer on new line denoting the number of distinct point that they would meet during 
CR which is going on for indefinite time. 

Constraints

1 <= T <= 100000
1 <= r <= 1000000
-1012 <= v1,v2 <= 1012

Example
Input:
2
2 1
4 2 

Output:
1 
1
