As it is New Year, let’s keep this question straight forward. You are given an array A of N integers A1,……AN.
A good sequence is defined as a non-empty sequence of integers such that the sum of elements in each and every of its sub-sequence is divisible by M. 
Can you find the total number of good sub-sequences of the array A?
[Note: a sub-sequence is a sequence that can be derived from the original sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.]
Input:

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N, M.
The second line contains N space separated integers A1,A2,….AN.

Output:
For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting the total number of good sub-sequences.
