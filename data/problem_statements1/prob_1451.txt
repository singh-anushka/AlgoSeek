Chef in association with Netaji Subhash Engineering College , decided to conduct a coding contest CODE-O-WAR for its students , to overcome the boredom during the Quarantine .
There are NN students in the college. The number of students is even. The ithith student has programming skill equal to Ai.
Chef wants to form N/2 teams with certain restrictions which goes as :

Each team should consist of exactly two students, and each student should belong to exactly one team.
Two students can form a team only if their skills are equal .

Students can solve problems to increase their skill. One solved problem increases the skill by one.
Chef wants to know the minimum total number of problems students should solve to form exactly N/2 teams (i.e. each pair of students should form a team). Your task is to help Chef in finding out the minimum number of problems to be solved.
Input:

First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
Each testcase contains of a single line of input, an integers N. 
Next line contains N space integer Ai,denoting skills of ith student.

Output:
For each testcase, print the minimum no. of problems to be solved .
Constraints

1≤T≤10
2≤N≤500
1≤Ai≤100000
N  is always Even

Sample Input:
   1
