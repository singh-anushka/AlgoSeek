In Chef Rami's kitchen, there is a long counter divided into NN sections (numbered 11 through NN). For each valid ii, there are aiai raw meals stacked on top of each other in section ii.
Chef Rami has a special cooking device. This device can take all the meals that are stacked in some section and instantly cook them. He may perform the following operations in any order any number of times (including zero), until all the meals are cooked:

Choose a section and use the device to cook all the meals in that section. This move costs XX units of energy regardless of which section it is applied to.
Choose a section ii (i≥2i≥2) and move all the meals that are located in section ii on top of the meals in section i−1i−1 (if there are 00 meals in section i−1i−1, all the meals from section ii are simply moved). The cost of this move is the number of meals located in section ii before the move.
Choose a section ii (i<Ni<N) and move all the meals that are located in section ii on top of the meals in section i+1i+1. The cost of this move is also the number of meals located in section ii before the move.

Since Chef Rami is lazy, he wants to spend the minimum amount of energy to cook all the meals. Help him calculate this value.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and XX.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers a1,a2,…,aNa1,a2,…,aN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the minimum number of units of energy Chef Rami needs to spend.

Explanation
Example case 1: One of the optimal solutions is to move all the meals from the second section to the third section, with cost 22, and then use the device on the first and third sections, with cost 33 units of energy per use. The total cost is 2+3+3=82+3+3=8 units of energy.
