In the forth coming days, we will be in College. Waiting anxiously for the college to open Mr. Fazlu is getting weird thoughts. One of his thoughts is: 


We have strings of length K based on the alphabet of size N. And he calls any of its substring beautiful if it is a palindrome and has a length S. 


You need to help Mr. Fazlu by finding
(the number of strings having any of its substring “beautiful” ) % (10^9+7).


Note: Here % means MODULO.

Input:

The only line of Input contains three unsigned integers:
K, N and S.

Output:

Print the (number of required strings) modulo (1000000007) i.e. 10^9+7

Constraints:

1<=K<=2000
1<=N<=2000
1<=S<=2000

Sample Input 1:
1 1 1
Sample Output 1:
 1
Sample Input 2:
5 2 4
Sample Output 2:
 2
EXPLANATION:
In case 1:

In the given test case only one such string is valid: “a” (let’s denote the only letter of our alphabet as “a”).

In case 2:

In the given test if we denote alphabet letters as “a” and “b” the following strings are valid:  “aaaaa” and “bbbbb”.
