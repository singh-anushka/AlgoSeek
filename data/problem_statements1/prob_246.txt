You are given a set SS, which is a subset of {1,2,…,N}{1,2,…,N}.
Consider a permutation P1,P2,…,PNP1,P2,…,PN of the integers 11 through NN. The cost of this permutation is the number of indices i>1i>1 such that PiPi is divisible by Pi−1Pi−1 and PiPi−1∈SPiPi−1∈S.
For each kk between 00 and N−1N−1 (inclusive), find the number of permutations with cost kk. Since these numbers may be large, compute them modulo 998,244,353998,244,353.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer NN.
The second line contains a binary string TT with length NN. For each valid ii, the ii-th character of TT is '1' if i∈Si∈S or '0' otherwise.

Output
Print a single line containing NN space-separated integers. For each kk (0≤k<N0≤k<N), the k+1k+1-th of these integers should be the number of permutations with cost kk, modulo 998,244,353998,244,353.
Constraints
