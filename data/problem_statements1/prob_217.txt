"We’ve already come too far to end this now".
NN players advance to the fifth round and the game is going to be Hopscotch. Every player has to select one mannequin before the start of the game.
Players are numbered 11 to NN. You are given an array AA of size NN, where    

If Ai=iAi=i, the ithith player selects their own mannequin.
If Ai=jAi=j where j≠ij≠i, the ithith player decides the mannequin for the jthjth player.
If Ai=0Ai=0, the ithith player hasn’t decided yet.

The VIPs want to know the number of ways that the undecided players can select mannequins such that everyone gets a mannequin, and no undecided players select their own mannequin.
It is guaranteed that every (non-zero) element in AA is unique, i.e, if 1≤i,j≤N1≤i,j≤N are such that i≠j,Ai>0i≠j,Ai>0, and Aj>0Aj>0, then Ai≠AjAi≠Aj.
Since the answer can be very large, print it modulo 109+7109+7.
Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer TT, denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer NN denoting the number of players.    
The second line contains NN space-separated integers, the ithith of which is AiAi as described in the statement above.

Output Format
For every test case, print one line containing the number of ways undecided players can select mannequins for others such that everyone receives a mannequin, modulo 109+7109+7.

Explanation
Test Case 1: There is no undecided player, so the number of ways is 00.
Test Case 2: There are 33 ways for the last 33 players to decide mannequins, all of which are listed below:

4→2,5→4,6→54→2,5→4,6→5
4→5,5→4,6→24→5,5→4,6→2
4→5,5→2,6→44→5,5→2,6→4

where a→ba→b means that aa selects the mannequin for bb.
