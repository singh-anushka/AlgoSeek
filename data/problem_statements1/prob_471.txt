Ansh and Parth love playing games with arrays. But unfortunately, Parth never succeeds to beat Ansh. But this time Parth came up with a new game which he expects Ansh to lose.
Ansh has to find the number of ways to construct  an array such that every consecutive element in the array has a different value. Also every element in the array should be in the range $[L, R]$ (both inclusive). Apart from these, Parth also need the elements with index $i$ and $j$ to be integers $X$ and $Y$ respectively, where $i$ and $j$ lies in the range $[1, N]$ while $X$ and $Y$ lies in the range $[L, R]$ as stated above.
It is guaranteed that if $j$ = $i + 1$ then $X$ and $Y$ are different.
Input:

First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then each testcase follow two lines.
First line of each testcase contains three space - separated integers : $N, L, R$ denoting size of array, lower and upper range of integers to be filled respectively.
Second line contains four space-separated integers $i, X, j, Y$ denoting first index, element in index $i$, second index and element in index $j$ respectively.

Output:
For each testcase, output one integer, the number of ways to fill the array. Since the answer may be large, find it modulo $10^9 + 7$.
Constraints

$1 \leq T \leq 10$
$3 \leq N \leq 5 * 10^8$
$1 \leq L, R, X, Y \leq 10^9$
$1 \leq i  \lt  j \leq N$
$L\leq X, Y  \leq R$

Sample Input:
3
3 1 5
1 1 3 2
4 1 5
2 1 4 1
10000000 1 1000000000
4 2 5 3

Sample Output:
3
16
980839842

EXPLANATION:
Sample testcase 1: All possible arrays are: $[1, 3, 2]$, $[1, 4, 2]$ and $[1, 5, 2]$.
So, the number of ways to fill the array is 3.
