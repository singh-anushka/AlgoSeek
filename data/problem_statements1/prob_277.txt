Chefland consists of nn cities numbered 11, 22, …n…n. The cities numbered 11, 22, …k…k are special cities. For each unordered pair i,ji,j, there exists a bidirectional road, destroying which has a cost of wi,jwi,j. Find the minimum cost of destroying some subset of roads so that no two special cities have a path between them after the removal of these roads.
Input
There are multiple independent testcases.

First line will contain TT, number of testcases.
The first line of each testcase contains nn and kk, the number of cities and the number of special cities respectively.
The jthjth integer in ithith of the next nn lines is wijwij.

Output
For each testcase, output the minimum cost of destroying some subset of roads so that no two special cities have a path between them after the removal of these roads.

Example Output
11

Explanation
Remove the roads (1,2)(1,2), (1,3)(1,3), (1,4)(1,4), (2,3)(2,3), (2,4)(2,4) to get a cost of 1+4+2+2+2=111+4+2+2+2=11.
