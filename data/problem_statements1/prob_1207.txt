Given a positive integer AA, find the total number of ordered pairs (B,C)(B,C) such that A+B2C is any perfect square, where B and C are positive integers ranging between 1 to 105.

Input:

First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
Each test case contains a single number A.


Output:
For each testcase, output in a single line answer i.e. total number of ordered pairs.

Constraints
1≤T,A≤105

Subtasks
Subtask #1 (20 points) 

1≤T≤10,
1≤A≤103

 Subtask #2 (80 points)
Original Constraints

Sample Input:
1

7
Sample Output:
1


EXPLANATION:
A=7
Possible pairs  (B,C) are (3,1)

7+32=16.

Only above pair is able to produce perfect square number i.e. 16 perfect square of 4. Thus answer is 1.
