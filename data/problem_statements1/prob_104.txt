You are given a string SS. Find the number of ways to choose an unordered pair of non-overlapping non-empty substrings of this string (let's denote them by s1s1 and s2 in such a way that s2 starts after s1 ends) such that their concatenation s1+s2 is a palindrome.
Two pairs (s1,s2) and (s′1,s′2) are different if s1 is chosen at a different position from s′1 or s2 is chosen at a different position from s′2.
Input
The first and only line of the input contains a single string S.
Output
Print a single line containing one integer — the number of ways to choose a valid pair of substrings.
Constraints

1≤|S|≤1,000
S contains only lowercase English letters
