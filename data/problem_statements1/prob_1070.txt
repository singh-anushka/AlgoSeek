The Chef owns an apple farming business. He has been making a lot of money off it and over the years he has started to become more generous out of generosity this year our chef has decided to donate his apples.
Now our chef wants to donate his apples in two cycles such that in each cycle he donates half of what he has (if he has an odd number of apples he donates the smaller portion).
You will be given the total number of apples he initially has and have to find the number of apples left with the chef after both the cycles of donation.
Constraints:
1<=TT<=100
1<=NN<=100000 .
Here N  is the total number of apples he has initially.
Input:
The first line contains a number T the total number of testcases.
The next T lines contain
A single integer N containing the total number of apples he has initially.
Output:
A single integer which is the number of apples he has left.
Example:
Input:
2
3
100                                                                                         
Output:
1
25                                                                                   
Explanation 1:
Cycle 1: Chef has 3 apples initially he donates half which is 1.5 but that isn’t possible so keeps the larger portion i.e 2 and donates 1.
Cycle 2: Chef has 2 apples now he donates half which is 1 Now he’s left with 1 .
Explanation 2:
Cycle 1: Chef has 100 apples initially he donates half which is 50 and keeps the rest 50.
  Cycle 2: Chef has 50 apples now he donates half which is 25 Now he’s left with 25 .
