A lot of people participating in a contest are obsessed with looking at the leaderboard to see how they are doning (Even you might have checked it just now. Hope you are doing well :P).
Considering there are NN teams participating and there are M problems in the contest. What would be the expected number of problems solved by the team at rank K on the leaderboard?
If the expected value is P/Q you must print the value P∗Q−1%MOD, where MOD=109+7.
Input

First line contains T, number of test case,
For each test case, you are given 3 space seperated integers N, M and K.

Output

For each test case print the desired answer.

Constraints

1≤T≤10
1≤K≤N≤109
1≤M≤50

Sample Input
2
1 1 1
2 2 2

Sample Output
500000004
545454550

Explanation
For the first test case, there can be only 2 possiblities(Here S represents solved and U represents unsolved) - 
U
S
Therefore expected number of problems solved by rank 1 = 1∗(1/2)+0∗(1/2)=1/2
For the second example there can be 11 possibilities - 
2 problems solved by rank 2 -
SS
SS
1 problem solved by rank 2 -

0 problem solved by rank 2 -

Therefore expected number of problems solved by rank 2 - 0∗(4/11)+1∗(6/11)+2∗(1/11)=8/11
