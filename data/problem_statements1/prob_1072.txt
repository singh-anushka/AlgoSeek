Akshay found some electrical motors of XX rpm speed. He made a car from this motor with wheels of radius r cm. The motor is connected to a battery which lasts for t mins. Akshay wants to know how far did the car travel before the battery exhausted.

Note:- Output the floor value 

Input:

First-line will contain T, the number of test cases. Then the test case follows. 
 Each test case contains X,r,t (speed of the motor,radius of the wheel and time respectively)

Output:
For each test case, print the floor value distance(in cm) covered by the car
