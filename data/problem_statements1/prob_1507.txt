The chef has n arrays each array has an m number of elements.  For each array given, You have to find the maximum sum of a subsequence with the constraint that no two numbers in the sequence should be adjacent to each other in the array and store it in the new array which will be of the size n.
 Now, you have a  single new array of size n. From that find the minimum sum of a subsequence by using the maximum number of elements in an array with the constraint that no two numbers in the sequence should be adjacent to each other in the array and print it.
Input:
-the first line of input contains T test cases.

For each test case,
there are two integers n,mn,m. 
for next n lines, each line contains m integers

Output:
The answer is a single line output printing a number.
Constraints

1≤T≤1021≤T≤102
1≤n≤4
1≤m≤105
1≤a[i]≤109

Sample Input:
    1
    3 4
    1 2 4 3
    1 1 3 1
    3 4 2 1

Sample Output:
4

EXPLANATION:
This list is :
from 
[1,2,4,3]    gives 5 as maximum sum(sum of subsequence [2,3]),
[1,1,3,1]   gives 4 as maximum sum(sum of subsequence [1,3]),
[3,4,2,1]   gives 5 as maximum sum(sum of subsequence [4,1]). 
After this, we get an array of size n with elements found above i.e[5,4,5].
Now [5,4,5]  gives 4 as the minimum sum(sum of subsequence [4]).
Hence the answer is 4.
