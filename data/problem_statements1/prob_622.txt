You are given a graph with NN vertices (numbered 11 to NN) and M bidirectional edges, which doesn't contain multiple edges or self-loops — that is, the given graph is a simple undirected graph.
For each pair of vertices a,b such that 1≤a,b≤N, it is possible to add a new edge between vertices a and b to the graph, with a cost of (a−b)2.
Find the minimum cost of adding edges so that vertex N is reachable from vertex 1.
Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains 2 space-separated integers, N and M.
The ith of the next M lines contains 2 space-separated integers ui and vi, denoting a bidirectional edge between vertex ui and vertex vi in the graph.

Output Format
For each test case, output the answer in a single line.

Explanation
Test Case 1: Add an edge between vertices 1 and 2, with cost (1−2)2=1.
Test Case 2: Vertices 1 and 5 are already connected, so no edges need to be added.
