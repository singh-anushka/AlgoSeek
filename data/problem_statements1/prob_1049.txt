Arun placed a laser on a sheet making 45 Degree with both the edges at the top left corner. The sheet is a rectangle with dimensions of length n and width m.
Then he divided the sheet into n∗m boxes of size 1∗1. He then put mirrors along all edges of the sheet facing inward so that the laser reflects accordingly.
He considers the box illuminated if the laser passes through it. 
If the laser strikes the corner of the sheet then it will retrace its path.
Find the number of illuminated boxes.
Input:

First-line will contain T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. 
Each test case contains a single line of input, two integers N,M. 

Output:
For each test case, output in a single line number of illuminated boxes.
Constraints

1≤N,M≤109

Sample Input:
1
4 3

Sample Output:
12

EXPLANATION:
First test case:-
n = 4 and m = 3
