You are given a string SS with length NN. Determine if it is possible to find two non-empty strings A and B which satisfy the following conditions:

A+B=S, where + denotes string concatenation
B is a substring of A

Note: B is a substring of A if B can be obtained from A by deleting several (possibly zero) characters from the beginning and several (possibly zero) characters from the end. For example, "ab" is a substring of "cabd", but "ad" is not.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains a single string S.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing the string "YES" if it is possible to find strings A and B satisfying the given conditions or "NO" otherwise (without quotes).
Constraints

1≤T≤104
2≤N≤105
|S|=N
S contains only lowercase English letters
the sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 106

YES


Explanation
Example case 1: We can choose "cabd" as A and "ab" as B. We can see that A+B=S and B is a substring of A.
Example case 2: It is impossible to find two strings which satisfy the constraints. For example, when A is "yourcrushlovesyou" and B is "back", then A+B=S, but B is not a substring of A.
Example case 3: We can choose "wubbalubbadub" as A and "dub" as B.
